Health,"spatial correlation between malaria cases and water-bodies in anopheles sinensis dominated areas of huang-huai plain, china : malaria re-emerged in the huang-huai plain of central china during 2006â€“2008, dominated with anopheles sinensis as a vector. however, there is no information on strategies based on multi-factor analysis to effectively control the re-emergence of malaria in these areas. previous experience indicates some relationship between the distribution of water bodies and malaria cases, but more detailed data are not available and in-depth studies have not been conducted up to now. the objective of this study was to identify the relationship between the distribution of water bodies and presentation of malaria cases using spatial analysis tools in order to provide guidance to help formulate effective strategies for use in controlling the sources of malaria infection, based on the identification of risk areas and population. the geographic information of malaria cases and their surrounding water bodies were collected from suixi, guoyang, guzhen, yingshang, fengyang and yongqiao county in anhui province, yongcheng and tongbai county in henan province. all malaria cases distributed in 113 villages in these 8 counties were collected from the china information system for disease control and prevention and confirmed by household investigation. data on gis and malaria cases were mapped and analyzed with the software of arcgis 9.2 to identify the spatial correlation between malaria cases and water bodies. the distance from households with malaria cases to the nearest water bodies was used to calculate the or value by chi-square test. the risk area was identified through the comparison of or values in different distances. 357 malaria cases andÂ â€¦"

health,"senior conservative mps are urging boris johnson to consider changing the 2m social distancing rule to 1.5m, amid fears for the hospitality sector.  greg clark, chair of the commons science committee, told the daily telegraph it could ""be the difference between people being able to go to work and losing their jobs"".  former chancellor lord lamont said measures which could ""compensate"", such as face masks, should be considered.  other countries have different rules.  while some lockdown measures are being eased across the uk, the social distancing rules, which say people from different households should stay 2m (6ft 6ins) apart from each other, still apply.  however, former business secretary mr clark wrote to the prime minister asking for sage (scientific advisory group for emergencies) to review the rule.  even if sage did not recommend reducing the distance, it would be important for it to ""clarify the rationale"" behind 2m and explain ""why the guidance in the uk differs from so many international comparators,"" mr clark said.  france and italy say people should keep 1m (3ft) apart, as does the world health organization. germany recommends a distance of 1.5m (4ft 11ins), while spain, like the uk, has a 2m rule.  the us advises to keep 6ft apart.  on thursday, england's chief medical officer professor chris whitty reiterated that it was ""really important"" that people stayed 2m away from each other.  speaking to bbc radio 4's today programme, lord lamont called on the advice to be re-examined, saying social distancing was causing ""huge problems"" for the hospitality sector.  ""if you want a single measure that could help the hospitality sector, it would be a reduction in the social distancing from 2m to 1m,"" the tory peer said, but insisted he would not want the government to ""ignore"" scientific and medical advice.  his comments come days after kate nicholls, chief executive of uk hospitality, called for the distance to be reduced even further, to 1m (3ft 4ins).  she said: ""if you have 2m social distancing that's the difference between opening at 30% of normal revenues or 60% with 1m social distancing.""  what does the science say about the 2m rule?  a simple guide is that the closer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk.  also the longer a person spends in close proximity with an infected person, the more the chance of catching the virus increases.  sage reported that being exposed for six seconds at 1m is comparable to a one-minute exposure at 2m.  in its latest paper on the issue, from april, it recommends keeping the rule, saying 2m is a ""good measure"" of the distance where the direct person-to-person transmission risk drops significantly.  but it says it should be seen as a ballpark guide to distancing rather than an absolute value.  read more on the science behind the 2m rule here.  former brexit secretary david davis said changes to the government's furlough scheme should be implemented ""in-step"" with a relaxation of the 2m rule.  the government is currently paying 80% of the salaries of 8.4 million uk workers - up to Â£2,500 a month - but from august, employers will have to start sharing the cost.  however mr davis said some firms would be unfairly disadvantaged if they had to shut because they could not social distance, while being forced to start paying towards staff costs again.  speaking on thursday, mr johnson said: ""i must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay 2m apart from those who you do not live with."""
health,"as the crisis has unfolded, scientists have discovered more evidence about a strange and worrying feature of the coronavirus. while many people who become infected develop a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell, others have no symptoms at all and never realise they're carrying covid-19.  researchers say it's vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether ""silent spreaders"" are fuelling the pandemic.  when people gathered at a church in singapore on 19 january, no-one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus. it was a sunday and, as usual, one of the services was being conducted in mandarin. among the congregation at the life church and missions, on the ground floor of an office building, was a couple, both aged 56, who'd arrived that morning from china.  as they took their seats, they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus. at that time, a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of covid-19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it. having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it.  the couple left as soon as the service was over. but shortly afterwards, things took a turn for the worse, and in a wholly confusing way. the wife started to become ill on january 22, followed by her husband two days later. because they had flown in from wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, that was no big surprise.  but over the following week, three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason, leading to one of singapore's first and most baffling coronavirus cases. working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims.  mobilising 'disease detectives'  ""we were extremely perplexed,"" says dr vernon lee, head of communicable diseases at singapore's ministry of health. ""people who didn't know one another somehow infected each other,"" while showing no sign of illness. this new batch of cases simply did not make sense, according to what was known about covid-19 back then.  so dr lee and his fellow scientists, along with police officers and specialist disease trackers, launched an investigation, generating detailed maps showing who was where and when. this involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing - a version of which is getting under way now in the uk. it's seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out, and singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out.     early in the pandemic, singapore was seen as a shining example of how to tackle the virus  amazingly, within a few days, investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that sunday. they quickly established that two of the singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the chinese couple.  ""they could have spoken to each other, greeted each other, during the usual activities of a church service,"" says dr lee.  that was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on, apart from one key factor. it did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease.  and on top of that was an even greater puzzle. it was confirmed that the third singaporean to become infected, a 52-year-old woman, had not been at the same service as the others. instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day, so how could she have picked up the virus?  evidence no-one expected  investigators resorted to going through the cctv recordings made at the church that sunday to search for clues. and they stumbled across something completely unexpected - the woman who'd attended the later service, after the chinese couple had left, had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier.  somehow, despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill, the chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus. maybe they'd had it on their hands and touched the seats, maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface, it's not clear, but the implications were huge.  for dr lee, piecing everything together, there was only one possible explanation - that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising. this was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others.  but if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms, silently and invisibly, how could the disease be stopped? he remembers the moment, while working in his office, when the reality dawned on him. ""every time you make a scientific discovery, it is like a 'eureka' moment when you realise that this is something important that you've uncovered, through the hard work of many individuals and teams.""  spread before symptoms show  what was revealed was what's known as ""pre-symptomatic transmission"" where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough, fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin.     singapore saw a rise in cases after appearing to have the virus under control  along with many others, this study highlighted a critical period of 24-to-48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious, perhaps even their most infectious.  being aware of that is potentially invaluable, because as soon as you realise you're ill then everyone you've been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home.  that would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start. but exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate.  one option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job. if the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then it's possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation. anyone close enough, especially indoors, could easily pick it up.  and another potential form of transmission is by touch - the virus gets onto someone's hands and they touch another person or a door handle - or a seat in a church. whatever the route, the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if they're not aware that they might be infected.  some people never show symptoms  this is an even more mysterious scenario, and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to. it's one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show, quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it.  this is what's known as being ""asymptomatic"" because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself. the most famous case is that of an irish woman who was working as a cook in new york at the beginning of the last century.     wherever mary mallon was employed, in house after house, people became ill with typhoid and at least three, maybe many more, died of it, but she was completely unaffected. eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease.  reporters dubbed her ""typhoid mary"", a label she always resented, but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938.  assumptions undermined  staff nurse amelia powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic. she was at work on her hospital ward at addenbrooke's hospital in cambridge in april when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test.  she had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with covid-19. but suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because, to her horror, she had tested positive.  ""it was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed, it was surreal. ""i thought, 'this can't be right, not me, i'm absolutely fine,'"" says 23-year-old amelia.  she had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home.  ""i was worried because i've seen the other side, with patients deteriorating very quickly with it, so i did wonder if this would happen to me."" but, to her surprise, at no point did she feel unwell. ""i had nothing, literally - i was exercising indoors, eating normally, sleeping normally.""  at the moment it's impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view.  the discovery that amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital. it produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1,000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test.  an even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the diamond princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of japan earlier this year. later branded ""a petri dish for infection"", it had around 700 cases.  researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms.  and at a care home in washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness.  'no single reliable study'  different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases. that was the conclusion of an analysis by prof carl heneghan of the university of oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects.  the upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". and they said that if the screening for covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of uk testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"".  the risk of 'silent spreaders'  the biggest concern of amelia, the nurse, was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help.  ""i don't think i passed it on because all the colleagues i work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long i'd been positive for,"" she says. ""but we still don't know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not - it's very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal.""  one study in china which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities. ""as 'silent spreaders',"" the scientists wrote, ""asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.""     the team that studied that diamond princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so they're estimated to have caused a significant number of cases.  the 'dark matter' of asymptomatic infection  to try to get an answer, scientists in norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested.  ""asymptomatic cases may be the 'dark matter' of the epidemic,"" according to prof neil hall, head of the earlham institute, a life science research centre, who's leading the initiative. dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe, and it's yet to be identified.  prof hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic, keeping it going despite public health measures. ""if you have people who don't know they're ill while using public transport and health care facilities, inevitably that's going to increase transmission,"" he says.  ""any intervention that's only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem.""  a team of scientists in california believes that not knowing who's carrying the virus without symptoms is the ""achilles heel"" of the fight against the pandemic.     china launched a mass testing programme in wuhan  in their view, the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out who's infected regardless of whether they think they are or not. that was also the recommendation of mps on the commons science and technology committee in a letter to the prime minister boris johnson.  they wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has ""a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic"". and they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people - such as health workers or care workers - should be given regular testing.  a similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the chinese city of wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have begun.  as many as 6.5 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease - including in those showing no symptoms.  easing of lockdown  as lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport, return to work or go shopping, getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever. at the moment, there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing.  that's why governments the world over say it's essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self-isolates. they also advise that the best defence remains social distancing - to keep apart wherever you can. but where that isn't possible, the recommendation is to cover your face, even with a mask that's homemade.     more and more governments are advising wearing face masks  when the us government announced this policy, it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in singapore back in january. the logic is that this is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting others from you, in case you're infected but don't know it.  many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing, or increase the risk of contamination if they're clumsily handled. but more and more governments, most recently that of the uk, have become convinced of the benefits.  not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own. but because there's still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission, almost anything is worth a try.  you may also be interested in:  when you talk to intensive care doctors across the uk, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: ""we've never seen anything like this before.""  they knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in china at the end of last year.  ""it felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the d-day landings,"" says barbara miles, clinical director of intensive care at glasgow royal infirmary, ""with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing"".  read a summary, often in their own words, of what doctors have learnt about how covid-19 attacks the human body."
health,"science photo library  cancer patients need to take extra care  around 2.5 million people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home.  this ""shielding"" is to protect lives.  why do it?  while everyone is being advised to keep their distance from other people to help stop the spread of coronavirus, some people with underlying health conditions need to take even more precautions to protect themselves.  the guidance on shielding is being kept under review as the uk moves out of lockdown.  people in england and wales who have been asked to stay at home and shield will be able to spend some time outdoors again from monday 1 june, while continuing to follow social distancing rules.  it means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. people living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing - keeping 2 metres apart.  other parts of the uk have not yet recommended the same.  who should shield?  those most at risk, who include:  solid organ transplant recipients  some people with cancer who are undergoing treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy  people on immunosuppression drugs  women who are pregnant and have heart disease  people with severe respiratory conditions - cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and copd  some people with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency  while it is true that the risk from coronavirus goes up with age, over half of those shielding are under the age of 70, say officials. over 90,000 are children.  anyone in this highest risk category who has not yet received a letter from the nhs or been contacted by their doctor should get in touch with their gp or hospital doctor by phone or online.  this does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to practise social distancing.  is it compulsory?  experts strongly advise people with serious underlying health conditions to follow the advice. if this applies to you, shielding is for your personal protection - it is your choice to decide whether to follow the recommendations.  you could call your doctor to discuss this.  what does it entail?  it means staying at home and following the guidelines. you should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes.  you should avoid any face-to-face contact, so that means no visitors.  visits from people who provide you essential healthcare and personal support are fine. carers and care workers should stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus and anyone coming into your home should keep their hands clean by washing with soap and water.  what about any people i live with?  they do not need to shield themselves but must make sure they follow recommendations to shield you.  they should also stringently follow the guidance on social distancing.  they should also keep some physical distance (two metres) from you and keep to a minimum the time spent in shared spaces such as the kitchen, bathroom and lounge. shared spaces should be kept well ventilated - open a window.  if you can, use a separate bathroom and bedroom from the rest of the household, and also make sure you use separate towels.   don't share cutlery  if you share a toilet and bathroom, make sure they are cleaned after every use. consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first.  use the kitchen when others are not in there and take your meals back to your room to eat. coronavirus is spread through droplets (from coughs and sneezes), so do not share cutlery or crockery, unless it is clean. use a dishwasher if you have one. soap or washing up liquid and water gets rid of the virus too.  keep surfaces that are frequently touched clean - door handles, taps and handrails.  what about my medicine and food?  communities minister robert jenrick said parcels of food, which would be free initially, and medicines would be delivered to those affected via community hubs.  the treasury will cover the cost and in time hope to refine the scheme so it is ""more tailored to individuals' needs"".  how long will shielding last?  in england, people have been asked to shield until the end of june and this date will be reviewed. in wales, it's 15 and in northern ireland and scotland people have been advised to shield for at least 12 weeks from when they were first told to.  the ultimate ambition is to be able to control the virus enough so that people can move out of shielding. a vaccine could help towards this.  what should i do if i get a cough or fever?  these are symptoms of coronavirus. it does not mean that you definitely have it, but you should contact the nhs 111 online coronavirus service or call nhs 111 or your doctor. do this as soon as you get symptoms. do not visit the gp, pharmacy, urgent care centre or hospital.  in an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill.  other tips to stay safe and well  good hygiene can stop the virus spreading:  keep physically active by exercising indoors or in your garden if that's possible.  look after your mental wellbeing. stay in touch with friends on the phone, by post or online.  prepare a hospital bag just in case - this should include your emergency contact, a list of medicines you take and any information on your planned care appointments as well as things you would need for an overnight stay, such as a toothbrush and pyjamas.  extra help  you can register for support with food, shopping and deliveries and additional care.  over two million food boxes have been delivered in england since the programme started."
health,"bryony hopkins  for those living with underlying health conditions, the thought of contracting coronavirus can be terrifying. but while the numbers may appear bleak, there are many people considered high risk who are making a full recovery, as i personally discovered.  panic rose in my chest as i failed to catch my breath. all i had done was walk up the stairs. was this covid-19? was it in my home, in my body, in my lungs?  i have crohn's disease, an autoimmune disease which means my digestive system attacks itself. it's classed as a ""serious underlying health condition"" at this time.  one of the main treatments is immunosuppressive therapies, drugs which reduce the strength of the body's immune system making it more susceptible to infections.  when the first coronavirus symptoms arrived - fever, tiredness - i naively thought ""this doesn't feel that bad"".  when you live with a chronic illness, you live with perspective. i have gone through health crises i wouldn't wish on my worst enemy - open abdominal operations, the removal of my large bowel and a few scrapes with death along the way.  so as my temperature spiked, my mind was full of questions and the horror stories i had read about. would i end up in hospital? would i need a ventilator? am i going to die?  there was no opportunity to be tested, but a doctor suggested it was covid-19. i was told to hold tight and go to a&e if my condition worsened.  after eight days, my symptoms eased. my suppressed immune system had done a good job.  i am not alone in my story. there are many people, like me, considered high risk who have made a full recovery.  ""i tried to stay positive even though i was scared""   khadija  khadija, 25 from leeds, has lived with type 1 diabetes since she was a baby. her pancreas no longer produces insulin, so an external pump, attached to her stomach, administers it for her.  ""i was really apprehensive when i heard i was in the high-risk category,"" she says. ""i just thought, 'i could get it and what would happen if i do?' i was frightened.""  khadija lives with her mum, a nurse who comes into contact with covid-19 patients, and four weeks ago she started to experience some of the virus symptoms.  she had ""achy bones"" and was ""really short of breath"" with chest pains and a temperature.  ""i was panicking at first when i got the symptoms. i knew my immune system wasn't up to scratch.  ""all over the news is the death rate, there wasn't anything about people recovering and surviving. the way i saw it was as soon as you go into hospital with it, you're not going to be coming out alive.""  paramedics were sent to her house, but they decided khadija didn't need to go to hospital. they suggested she call 111 to arrange a test, but none were available.  ""i tried to keep a positive outlook even though i was scared,"" she says.  a few weeks on and khadija has made a good recovery.  ""i felt safer inside""   freya  feya, 37, from manchester, lives with several chronic conditions including asthma, for which she takes steroids. steroids are also a form of immunosuppressants and therefore make you vulnerable to the virus.  before the lockdown, feya felt anxious. news of the virus dominated the media and she experienced a panic attack while out shopping.  ""it was the worst i've ever been,"" she says. ""i wasn't bothered about the lockdown because i felt safer inside.""  two weeks later, feya felt unwell with fatigue and unsteady breathing. she visited her gp who told her to self-isolate.  but she rapidly deteriorated - ""i was coughing so much and struggling to breathe"" and her boyfriend had to call for an ambulance.  ""they said if we could make our own way to a&e that's what we should do because they were so busy.""  feya stayed in hospital for five hours but wasn't admitted so wasn't offered a covid-19 test. her symptoms persisted for another two weeks, including a second ambulance call-out, and she felt completely drained of energy for weeks, but slowly she recovered.  ""i went outside for the first time in two months the other day, which was nice!""  ""you can catch this and only have mild symptoms""   joe dunster  joe dunster has nephrotic syndrome, a kidney condition which resulted in a kidney transplant in 2000. he too is on immunosuppressants.  ""when it started to become apparent the transplant community were in the high-risk group, i needed to shield of course, so i got home and locked down,"" he says.  but that didn't stop him developing coronavirus symptoms. he believes he may have contracted it from his wife, a doctor, who also became unwell.  ""we both suffered from tightness of the chest. at first, we wondered if it was anxiety, but into the weekend i didn't feel quite right. i felt quite wheezy and went on to develop a cough.""  joe also developed a temperature and at that point felt all the symptoms pointed towards coronavirus.  ""the next few days i felt so unwell. the cough and the wheeze stuck around for 10 days.  he says there was ""anxiety"" about what it could turn into, ""but i never felt poorly enough to get seriously worried"".  slowly, he and his wife recovered.

health,"iproov  facial recognition in the nhs app could be used as the basis for immunity tests  facial recognition has been added as a way of logging in to an nhs app that lets people order prescriptions, book appointments and find healthcare data.  initially, it will allow faster access to the services on the app, which is separate from the contact-tracing one.  but its developers say it could also be used for covid-19 ""immunity passports"".  such passports, where people carry documented proof they have immunity because of a past infection, are already being tested in estonia.  health secretary matt hancock has previously hinted at the possible use of a ""system of certification"" for those with antibodies for coronavirus.  the nhs facial-recognition system, built by iproov and available in england for both android devices and ios, requires users to submit a photo of themselves from an official document such as their passport or driving license.  the system scans a person's face using their phone and, following a short sequence of flashing colours, their identification will be verified and they will have access to all the services on the nhs app.  more than a million people have now registered with nhs login, with a peak of more than 60,000 new ids verified during the first week of april.  founder andrew bud told bbc news: ""nhs digital has built a strong and trusted identity system in nhs login, which, in my opinion, should form the basis of the uk's immunity passport.  ""whether they do so is a decision for them.""  in response, a spokesperson for nhs digital said it ""has not been commissioned to apply this technology to any other purposes beyond providing a secure login capability via mobile devices"".  immunity passports need to link a person's identity to their coronavirus test results, so would require a robust way of allowing people to verify themselves.  those deemed clear of the virus could then prove their status via a code generated by an app.  the idea has proved controversial, not least because there is no hard scientific evidence that having had the coronavirus provides people with long-lasting immunity.  the world health organization has warned countries against implementing such passports, saying: ""there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.""  societal impact     more countries are gearing up to offer mass antibody tests to the public  but mr bud said: ""at-home antibody tests are coming soon and will quickly cause the creation of a whole information system, of which they will be at the heart.  ""that is inevitable and is no longer subject to political choice.  ""there are big questions that this system will pose to society - such as how to discourage people from uploading false immunity results, how to prevent discrimination on the basis of immunity status and how to stop information leaking uncontrollably.""  estonia has begun testing one of the world's first immunity passports, which would allow citizens to show their coronavirus test results to third parties, such as employers or even restaurants.  taavet hinrikus, founder of transferwise, the company is developing the technology for the estonian system, said it would ""diminish fears and stimulate societies all over the globe to move on with their lives amidst the pandemic"".  but dr tom fisher, a senior researcher at privacy international, said the implementation of such measures needed to be ""necessary, proportionate and based on the epidemiological evidence"".  ""for the moment, immunity passports do not meet this test,"" he said.  ""we must be concerned about the broad societal impact of such immunity passports.  ""they are essentially about limiting the rights of those who are not deemed to be immune.  ""this is a route to exclusion and discrimination.  ""similarly, an improperly implemented programme risks perverse effects, like people deliberately seeking to get infected to gain the benefits of a status of being immune.""  robin tombs, the chief executive of digital identity company yoti said it would be ""technically simple"" to extend its work with coronavirus testers at geneme to antibody tests but: ""the science on covid-19 immunity is still too early to issue meaningful immunity passports."""
health,"pa media  ""do everything you can to signal to friends that things are not back to normal""  the uk is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules, meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months.  under the new rules:  from monday, people in england can meet in groups of up to six people in outdoor spaces like parks or private gardens - as long as you remain two metres (six feet) apart  can meet in groups of up to six people in outdoor spaces like parks or private gardens - as long as you remain two metres (six feet) apart in scotland , members of two different households - up to eight people - are allowed to meet outdoors if they maintain social distancing  , members of two different households - up to eight people - are allowed to meet outdoors if they maintain social distancing in wales , people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from monday while maintaining social distancing  , people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from monday while maintaining social distancing groups of up to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in northern ireland if they stay two metres apart  we asked doctor and tv presenter xand van tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible.  details of the rules vary across the uk, so if you are living outside of england some of the advice below may not apply to you.   dr xand van tulleken: ""we have to have quite a high level of paranoia""  1. who to invite  the first thing to do is think about who you're inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them - we are very differently vulnerable to this virus.  if you're inviting overweight men who are older, they face a very different risk to young families with young children. if you're inviting people who've had the virus that's very different again. think about the invitation and think about who you're putting at risk.  if you're thinking of inviting a 70-year-old overweight man, i would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept.  if you're shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings.  2. how to arrive  if you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly, brilliant.  if they can't and people are walking through the house, it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask, wash their hands when they get into the house, and then go straight into the garden. they shouldn't touch anything. you need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible.  3. social distancing  to maintain social distancing, about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six-person gathering if everyone is from different households, which is massive.  if you had 12 two-metre by two-metre picnic blankets, you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that you're two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby. i don't expect everyone's got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that we're talking about.     one creative approach to distancing attempted in a brooklyn park  you need to find some way of measuring. you could get a two-metre pole, a bamboo cane, a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with, hold it and spin around in a circle - everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other.  in your garden, you could mark two metres out with blankets, chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people - no-one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench.  when we talk about gardens, i look at mine and it's a very small space. to have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible.  4. food and cutlery  in terms of bringing your own cutlery, it's difficult. everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk they're prepared to accept.  if you think you've had coronavirus and/or you're low risk, meaning you're young, you're slim, you're female - those are the main variables - your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other people's cutlery. but of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill.  if you are a man who's older and overweight and don't think you've had the virus, i would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw.  5. washing hands  if you're in the park you might not be able to wash your hands, so i would say bring hand gel, wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby.  if you're having people in your garden, you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption the university of westminster's dr adele mccormick demonstrates how to wash your hands  you could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way, then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off. if you're hosting, say to everyone ""we're all going to wash our hands once an hour"".  you could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says ""wash your hands"".  6. using the toilet  there needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet.  you should flush with the seat down - a lot of people don't bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids.  once you flush, then you need to wipe down the loo. you need either disinfectant wipes in the loo, or you need a spray with some disposable towels.  you also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so you're not re-contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom.  you want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom. all the surfaces need to be wiped down.  even then, remember it's not a risk-free zone. probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated - you are definitely taking a risk by doing this.  7. reunions with children  you're not allowed to hug people and that's the rule. but in my experience, if a small child wants a hug, it's virtually impossible to stop them. for people with nieces, nephews, grandchildren, godchildren or other important children in their lives who they haven't been able to see for a long time, if you're going to a picnic in their garden, it's going to be quite difficult to avoid contact.  i would say, if you do end up having a hug at least don't grab the person and pull them into your face. a proper full-frontal hug is the most dangerous, but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous.  the only safe advice though is not to hug.  8. alcohol and time-limits  you should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering. you are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population. we still have a high level of transmission in the uk.  alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when they're drunk.  the other thing is the time limit. if you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking, that's wildly different to coming over and saying we're going to sit two metres apart for an hour and we'll wear a mask on the way in.  anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer.  9. the clean-up  the virus either moves through the air, or it moves through droplets coming out of people's mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets. i would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left.  this virus is unpredictable and dangerous - significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the uk. we have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it."
health,"some children in england will be going back to school from monday 1 june.  following a heated debate, the government published the advice it received from scientists on what is known about the impact of more children returning to the classroom.  how dangerous is coronavirus for children?  children are at extremely low risk of becoming ill from the virus.  adults - and particularly older adults - are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications of the virus.  across the uk, 0.01% of deaths were people under 15, 1% were aged 15-44 and about 75% were over 75.  half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in england, wales and northern ireland were 60 as at 15 may, and half were younger, according to a research charity.  but the majority were over 50 and fewer than 10% were younger than 40.   in the uk, three children under 15 have died with coronavirus  children have so far only accounted for between 1% and 5% of all diagnosed cases, according to prof adilia warris, a paediatric infectious diseases specialist at the university of exeter.  they often have ""milder disease than adults,"" she says, pointing out that deaths have been rare.  there have been some extremely rare cases of children developing an inflammatory syndrome similar to kawasaki disease, and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus.  can children pass on coronavirus to others?  this is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle about coronavirus and how it spreads.  it is still not clear how infectious anyone with very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all is - at any age. to understand this we would need widespread antibody testing to identify who has had the virus across the whole population, and work out how they might have caught it.     a university college london review of the evidence, based on studies using contact tracing and population screening, suggested children were half as likely as adults to catch the virus.  the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies (sage) said the ""balance of evidence"" suggested children might be both less likely to catch it and, if they do catch it, less likely to pass it on. but the ""evidence remains inconclusive,"" it said.  one study looking at cases in shenzhen in china at the beginning of the year suggested that children were just as likely to catch the virus, raising the fear that they could be transmitting it without showing any symptoms. but research carried out since then has been more reassuring.  studies of clusters of infections in family groups across china have concluded - based on contact tracing - that none of the infections were likely to have been introduced by children.     a study of a cluster of infections in the french alps found that a child who tested positive for the virus did not pass it on to any of the more than 100 people they had contact with during the time they had symptoms.  community studies in iceland, south korea, the netherlands and italy all found evidence children were less likely to have - or have had - the virus than adults. the italian region studied tested 70% of its population.  a review of the evidence by a global team of researchers concluded: ""the role of children in transmission is unclear, but consistent evidence is demonstrating a lower likelihood of acquiring infection, and lower rates of children bringing infections into households.""  one theory for why children generally have no symptoms or milder ones is that their lungs might contain fewer of the receptors that coronavirus uses to infect cells. but experts say there is not yet any good evidence to support this.  what about the risks to staff?  more children in schools means more teachers working, and more parents at the school gates, and it's not yet clear how those extra contacts might affect the spread of infection.  as the sage report says, ""it is important to understand the other types of social distancing measures that staff, parents, and students are engaging in beyond the boundaries of the school.""  the group of scientists modelled nine different ""return to school"" scenarios.  on 16 may, deputy chief medical officer for england dr jenny harries said the government had opted for the one estimated to give the smallest increase in the r number - the measure of how fast the disease is spreading - while still bringing significant numbers of children back to school.     it was reported that in 22 european union countries where schools were partially reopened, there hadn't been a significant increase in cases, including among staff. these countries all opened up schools to different extents.  france did report a small uptick in cases after partially re-opening schools.  but world health organization (who) chief scientist dr soumya swaminathan agrees that children are ""less capable"" of spreading the virus, and are at ""very low risk"" of getting ill from the disease.  ""what we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools.""  why send primary school children back first?  government guidelines say it wants to start with reception, year 1 and year 6 children in england because:  these year groups have important educational needs  younger children are less likely to become unwell if infected  older children are more likely to have higher numbers of contacts outside school so pose a greater transmission risk  older children are typically better able to learn at home  the government says secondary schools in england will be able to reopen to year 10 and year 12 from monday 15 june.  but only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time  the schools minister nick gibbs told mps there is still no decision about the government's ambition to send all primary children in england back before the summer break.  what do i need to know about the coronavirus?"
health,"a protester's sign casts doubt on the existence of coronavirus during a demonstration in california in early may  a bbc team tracking coronavirus misinformation has found links to assaults, arsons and deaths. and experts say the potential for indirect harm caused by rumours, conspiracy theories and bad health information could be much bigger.  ""we thought the government was using it to distract us,"" says brian lee hitchens, ""or it was to do with 5g. so we didn't follow the rules or seek help sooner.""  brian, 46, is talking by phone from his hospital bed in florida. his wife is critically ill - sedated, on a ventilator in an adjacent ward.  ""the battle that they've been having is with her lungs,"" he says, voice wobbling. ""they're inflamed. her body just is not responding.""  after reading online conspiracy theories, they thought the disease was a hoax - or, at the very least, no worse than flu. but then in early may, the couple caught covid-19.  ""and now i realise that coronavirus is definitely not fake,"" he says, running out of breath. ""it's out there and it's spreading.""   brian lee hitchens  brian lee hitchens thought the virus was a hoax - until he and his wife caught it  dangerous misinformation  a bbc team has been tracking the human toll of coronavirus misinformation. we've investigated dozens of cases - some previously unreported - speaking to the people affected and medical authorities in an attempt to verify the stories.  the effects have spread all around the world.  online rumours led to mob attacks in india and mass poisonings in iran. telecommunications engineers have been threatened and attacked and phone masts have been set alight in the uk and other countries - all because of conspiracy theories.  and in arizona, a couple mistakenly thought a bottle of fish tank cleaner contained a preventative medicine.  poisoned by cleaning products  it was late march when wanda and gary lenius started to hear about hydroxychloroquine.  the couple noticed a similar-sounding ingredient on the label of an old bottle that was lying around their house in phoenix.  hydroxychloroquine may have potential to fight the virus - but as research continues, it remains unproven. on monday, the world health organisation halted its use in trials after a recent study suggested it could actually increase the risk of patients dying from covid-19.  speculation about its effectiveness started circulating online in china in late january. media organisations, including chinese state outlets, tweeted out old studies where it was tested as an anti-viral medicine.     president trump says he has been taking hydroxychloroquine  then a french doctor claimed encouraging results. although doubt was later cast on that study, interest in hydroxychloroquine surged. it was mentioned, with various degrees of scepticism, by a variety of media outlets and influential people including tesla chief executive elon musk and brazilian president jair bolsonaro.  it also found its way into white house press briefings - and president trump's twitter feed.  skip twitter post by @realdonaldtrump hydroxychloroquine & azithromycin, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine. the fda has moved mountains - thank you! hopefully they will both (h works better with a, international journal of antimicrobial agents)..... â€” donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) march 21, 2020 report  ""what do you have to lose?"" he said on 3 april. ""take it."" in mid-may, he went further - saying that he'd been following his own advice. each comment resulted in big spikes in social media chatter about the drug, according to data from online monitoring tool crowdtangle.  overdoses of the drug are rare, but the anxiety produced by the pandemic has driven people to extreme measures.  in nigeria, hospital admissions from hydroxychloroquine poisoning provoked lagos state health officials to warn people against using the drug.  and in early march, a 43-year-old vietnamese man was admitted to a poison control clinic in hanoi after taking a large dose of chloroquine. he was red, trembling and unable to see straight. the clinic's director, dr nguyen trung nguyen, said the man was lucky he received treatment quickly - or else he might have died.  gary lenius was not so fortunate. the cleaner he and wanda gulped down contained a different chemical, and was poisonous.  within minutes, both started feeling dizzy and hot. they vomited and struggled to breathe. gary died, and wanda was hospitalised.  wanda later explained why the couple drank the concoction.  ""trump kept saying it was pretty much a cure,"" she said.     president donald trump speaks at a daily press briefing about the pandemic  alcohol poisoning  in iran, authorities say hundreds have died from alcohol poisoning after viral rumours about its curative effects.  the total was put at 796 by the end of april by kambiz soltaninejad, an official from iran's legal medicine organisation, who said it was the result of ""fake news on social media.""  the truth behind the number is murky in a country where alcohol is banned in iran and bootleg moonshine is routinely contaminated.  however in this case, bbc journalists did see rumours of the supposed ""cure"" spreading on the messaging app telegram before the official announcement.  shayan sardarizadeh of bbc monitoring's disinformation team notes that the announcement was potentially embarrassing to the iranian authorities and, if anything, the number could be an underestimate.  in one case we verified, a 5-year-old boy went blind after his parents plied him with illegal booze in an attempt to fight the disease.  ""we know that bad information can ruin lives,"" says clare milne, deputy editor of uk fact-checking organisation full fact. ""there's such great potential for harm.""     iranian officials, including president hassan rouhani, meet to discuss the coronavirus pandemic  'my friend ate soap'  president trump has speculated on a number of other cures beside hydroxychloroquine. in late april, he opined that ultraviolet rays could neutralise the virus.  ""and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. one minute. and is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?""  trump later said his comments were sarcastic. but some americans didn't see it that way, and poison control hotlines received calls asking about the advice. officials at one in kansas said they heard from someone who said his friend swallowed disinfectant soap after the president's briefing.     dr duncan maru, a doctor at elmhurst hospital in new york, says his colleagues have treated patients who have become acutely ill after ingesting disinfectant.  ""these ingestions also can have long-term consequences, like cancers and gastrointestinal bleeding,"" he says.   dr duncan maru heads for a hospital shift treating coronavirus patients  arsons, assaults and conspiracies  social networks have also been fertile ground for conspiracy theories. one particular coronavirus-related one - there are many circulating online - has resulted in arsons and assaults.  across the uk, more than 70 phone masts have been vandalised because of false rumours that 5g mobile phone technology is somehow to blame for the virus.     a telephone mast was set on fire in huddersfield in april  in april, dylan farrell, an engineer for openreach, was driving his van in thurmaston near leicester. it had been a long day and he was thinking about what he might have for tea as he pulled up to a roundabout. that's when he started to hear shouting.  at first, he thought it was directed at someone else. but when he heard ""5g!"" being screamed through his passenger side window, he realised the shouting was meant for him.  ""you've got no morals!"" a man shouted. ""5g is killing us all!""   dylan farrell  dylan farrell was abused by a man shouting about 5g conspiracy theories  ""i have no doubt he would have tried to get inside and physically attack me had i not locked the doors straight away,"" dylan says. ""it was so frightening.""  he drove away quickly. there have been no arrests in connection with the incident.  ""we've seen a lot of conspiracies which have been online for a long time now about 5g,"" says claire milne of full fact. ""those have evolved to be connected to the new coronavirus.""   a man wearing a ""say no to 5g t-shirt"" who attended an anti-lockdown protest in central london in may. he was not involved in the violent attacks against telecoms workers  racial tensions and violent attacks  in march, who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus warned that the pandemic would lead to a flare up of a ""dangerous enemy"".  he was referring to racism against people from asia and china, but the virus has exacerbated tensions in several countries.  in april, three muslim men were violently attacked in separate incidents in delhi. they were beaten up after rumours circulated that muslims were spreading the virus.  in sisai, a small village in eastern india, rival gangs clashed. it came after an attack on a muslim boy, again linked to false rumours suggesting muslims were spreading disease. one young man lost his life and another was seriously injured.     muslim men pray in front of closed shops in new delhi during ramadan. many muslims in india fear they have been unfairly discriminated against during the pandemic  false reports have circulated within ethnic communities as well. in bradford, england, rumours circulated that non-white patients were being left to die.  and in indore, a city in west-central india, doctors on a mission to track down someone who might have been exposed to the virus were attacked with stones. misleading whatsapp videos claimed that healthy muslims were being taken away by health care workers and injected with the virus.  two doctors were left with serious injuries after the incident in early april.  critically ill from conspiracies  online disinformation can have direct consequences, and social media platforms such as facebook said they'll remove coronavirus posts that pose an immediate threat.  but it can also have indirect or delayed effects.  ""i hope she pulls through,"" says brian lee hitchens, the patient in florida who got sucked in by coronavirus conspiracy theories. ""but if i do lose her, she'll be in a better place.""   brian lee hitchens  brian used to believe conspiracy theories about coronavirus  brian and his wife didn't have one firm belief about the disease - instead they oscillated between thinking that the virus was a hoax, linked to 5g, or a real but mild ailment.  so they carried on as normal despite official warnings. brian went to work as a taxi driver in his hometown of jupiter. he went shopping and picked up his wife's medications. despite his wife's sleep apnoea and asthma, he didn't bother with social distancing or wearing a mask.   facebook  brian and his wife at a party before the pandemic  catching the virus brought brian back to reality. he turned to social media, this time to warn people off of misinformation and conspiracy theories.  experts say posts like brian's may be more useful in combating conspiracies than news articles and fact checks.  ""one of the most effective ways of trying to correct the record,"" says full fact's claire milne, ""is by getting the person who made the original claim to do it themselves.""  'we lose so many lives because of misinformation'  brian's may be an extreme case, but with the sheer amount of information circulating - the who has called it an ""infodemic"" - many other people have been misled by what they read online.  they're not killing themselves by taking fake cures. instead, they're lowering their chances of survival by not thinking coronavirus is real or serious.  on an unusually cold friday in may, two men in their forties arrived at an emergency hospital in the new york borough of queens. they were roommates, working long shifts and sharing a single bed, and both were seriously ill.  within hours, dr rajeev fernando saw one die in front of his eyes. the other was put on a ventilator.   dr rajeev fernando  dr rajeev fernando working at an emergency hospital set up in new york  dr fernando asked the men why they hadn't come to hospital sooner. they explained to him that they read somewhere online that the virus wasn't very serious.  ""they try alternative therapies,"" dr fernando says. ""they think this is just like the flu.""  the men were in at-risk groups - but dr fernando believes they would have fared better if they had ignored the misleading advice and sought help sooner.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption ""fake news"" can spread like a virus  professor martin marshall, chair of the royal college of general practitioners, says he and his colleagues in the uk have seen patients taking tips from posts they see online - including holding their breath in an attempt to ""diagnose"" themselves or thinking that drinking hot drinks will fight off the virus. some have cited president trump's statements about disinfectant.  dr maru, the doctor at new york's elmhurst hospital, calls the numbers who have potentially delayed treatment ""staggering.""  he knows of neighbours who have caught the disease and died because they believed that social distancing is ineffective or that coronavirus is a hoax. and he says that he and his colleagues spend precious time trying to debunk misinformation when they could be treating patients.   anti-5g graffiti in new york city  but as he spoke on the phone, exhausted and preparing to return to elmhurst for another shift, dr maru was also quick to shift the blame away from the patients themselves.  ""misinformation is a structural problem,"" he says. ""blaming somebody for ingesting bleach or for staying at home and dying is akin to blaming somebody who is walking down the street and gets hit by a drunk driver.""  in response to the wave of misinformation, social media companies have drawn up new rules. in a statement, facebook said: ""we don't allow harmful misinformation and have removed hundreds of thousands of posts including false cures, claims that coronavirus doesn't exist, that it's caused by 5g or that social distancing is ineffective."" the company also says it has put warning labels on 90 million pieces of content.  youtube says it does not allow content promoting dangerous so-called cures and has a range of policies against covid-19 misinformation, including disputing the existence of the disease or suggesting that it is caused by 5g.  what lies ahead  but as research continues into a coronavirus vaccine, many anti-vaccination and conspiracy-minded groups and accounts have seen their numbers swell. they pose a potential health threat - albeit not an immediate risk.  what some doctors we spoke to fear the most is that the development of a coronavirus vaccine - something that would be a human achievement for the ages - could be completely undermined by misinformation.   protesters promoting conspiracies about vaccines and 5g attend a protest in st james's park, london in may.  the future is scary, medical professionals say, because of what they're seeing right now.  ""we lose so many lives. they come in very late,"" says dr fernando in new york. he's just finished a night shift, and as we talk on skype, a protective mask dangles from his ears. ""and we just watch them die in front of our eyes.""  brian, the coronavirus patient in florida, has a message for the people who still believe in the conspiracy theories he endorsed just a few days ago.

health,"graffiti on a wall in edinburgh  england, scotland, wales and northern ireland all have their own powers when it comes to easing the lockdown.  in northern ireland, groups of up to six people who do not share a household can now meet outdoors, with social-distancing measures in place.  but in england, the guidance is to meet only one other person outside your household outdoors.  the different policies are down to a number of factors, including geography, science and politics, experts say.  and as we ""tiptoe out of lockdown"", the lines between science and policy are likely to become ever more blurred.  how do rules vary across the uk?  northern ireland: ""groups of four to six people who do not share a household can meet outdoors maintaining social distancing.""  england: ""you can meet one other person from outside your household if you are outdoors. public gatherings of more than two people from different households are prohibited in law. there are no limits on gatherings in the park with members of your household.""  wales: the advice remains to stay at home, except to go outside for food, health reasons or work (but only if is not reasonably practicable to work from home). ""the overarching aim is that people should stay at home as much as possible. however, exercising outdoors is an important exception to this rule and is encouraged..."" wales' health minister is considering whether people should be able to meet loved ones not in their household outdoors. the next review of the rules is on 28 may.  scotland: the advice is similar to that in wales. first minister nicola sturgeon says her ""route map"" to lifting lockdown will be published on thursday, with restrictions likely to be eased from 28 may.     the ""stay home,"" message still applies  why do they vary?  even within the uk, we should think of ""a lot of different epidemics"" rather than a single pandemic, according to keith neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases, at the university of nottingham.  it is ""quite reasonable"" for northern ireland, which shares a border with the republic of ireland, to be out of step with the rest of the uk.  and studies suggests the reproduction (r) number, a measure of virus transmission, varies by region.   if the r number is above one, the number of cumulative cases takes off - but if it is below one, the outbreak eventually stops  is the advice based on science, policy or both?  the uk government is advised by a panel of scientific experts, including epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, virologists and medical doctors.  but prof james wilsdon, an expert in science policy, at the university of sheffield, says the lines between evidence-based science and politics are becoming ""very blurred"" and this will increase ""as we try and tiptoe our way out of lockdown"".  there are ""very difficult decisions to navigate"" and the ""cracks are starting to show"".  rowland kao, a professor of epidemiology and data science, at the university of edinburgh, says different governments have to consider ""all sorts of balancing acts"", when it comes to using science to inform policy.  ""policy decisions will inevitably be a mixture of scientific advice, an understanding of social and economic impacts and the ability to carry out any decisions,"" he adds.  follow helen on twitter."
health,"people who have been in close contact with someone found to have covid-19 are now being traced.  the nhs contact tracers will ask people they get in touch with to self-isolate for a fortnight.  what happens if i test positive for coronavirus?  the hope is that contact tracing will avoid the need for national lockdowns, with more local restrictions used instead.  anyone in england with coronavirus symptoms can now get a test. if it's positive you'll be contacted by text, email or phone and asked to log on to the nhs test and trace website.  there you will be asked for personal information including:  name, date of birth and postcode  who you live with  places you visited recently  names and contact details of people you have been in close contact with in the 48 hours before your symptoms started  close contacts are:  people you spend 15 minutes or more with at a distance of less than 2m  people you have direct contact with - such as sexual partners, household members or people with whom you have had face-to-face conversations at a distance of less than 1m  the contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared.  no one contacted as a result of you testing positive for coronavirus will be told your identity.  a parent or guardian will need to give permission for a call with under-18s to continue.  what about other parts of the uk?  northern ireland was the first of the four uk administrations to bring in contact tracing, which is being carried out exclusively by telephone at the moment.  scotland's system is called nhs test and protect, with 700 contract tracers at the moment - increasing to 2,000 later. it was launched as the easing of lockdown restrictions began.  in wales, the ''test, trace, protect'' system launched on 1 june.  what if i am contacted by the tracers?  anyone deemed at risk of infection will be told to stay at home for 14 days.  you will be asked to self-isolate, even if you do not have symptoms, to stop you from unknowingly spreading the virus.  this means that you should not leave your home for any reason. if you need food or medicine, you should order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off on your doorstep.  the people you live with won't have to self-isolate, unless they also develop symptoms, but they must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing.  the tracers can track down the contacts of 10,000 people every day, the government says.  it's hoped the system - already used in places like hong kong, singapore and germany - will slow the spread of coronavirus.  how do i avoid scammers?  the nhs test and trace service will not ask you:  for bank details, or payments  for details of any other accounts, such as social media  to set up a password or pin number over the phone  to call a premium rate number, such as those starting 09 or 087  england's health secretary matt hancock says the tracers will only be calling from 0300 0135 000.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption watch: what is contact tracing and how does it work?  do i have to follow the instruction to self-isolate?  health secretary matt hancock said he was confident the ""vast majority of people"" would do their ""civic duty"" and follow the nhs test and trace instructions - which are currently voluntary.  since then, the department for health has said that if people don't comply ""we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures, for example making visits to check they're home or issuing fines if they are found outside the house"".     what about sick pay?  if people can't work from home, the government says employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer.  statutory sick pay (ssp) is Â£95.85 per week and paid by your employer for every day you are in isolation, as long as you meet the eligibility conditions.  there are fears that many workers will not be able to live on that amount and will be forced to keep working.  shadow health secretary jonathan ashworth has urged the government to introduce ""enhanced"" sick pay.  ""there will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make [self-isolating] difficult for them so they need that security,"" he said.     when will the contact-tracing app be ready?  a smartphone app which would automatically alert people that they've been in contact with someone with coronavirus is still being trialled on the isle of wight.  it was originally due to be rolled out nationwide in mid-may, but the government now says it will be ready ''in the coming weeks''.  with bluetooth switched on, the app would work in tandem with manual tracing - and could help get hold of people who might not personally know the person who has tested positive.  the isle of wight trial suggests that at the moment, because of lockdown, people have not been spending 15 minutes in the close company of many others - mainly only those with whom they live.  how have other countries used contact tracing?  contact tracing has been credited with helping to lift restrictions in other places:"
health,"on 11 march hannah macdonald returned to work as a nurse. due to mental ill health her last shift had been 12 years before. march 11 was also the day the world health organisation declared covid-19 a global pandemic.  this article touches upon themes including self-harm and suicide   hannah mcdonald  hannah ""always had a heart"" for caring, even as a child, but by the time she was 18 she had faced multiple traumas: ""i'd had a friend who had drowned, a friend who had taken their own life, and a friend who had been murdered.""  she didn't attend the funerals and no one talked to her about the deaths. instead, she buried the pain and moved on with her life.  first she studied at the royal school of needlework at hampton court palace then she moved into nursing and worked at a london hospital with hiv patients. it was a job she loved, but it was emotionally challenging.  ""i was seeing other people's pain, and then i just couldn't deal with the emotional pain that was inside me,"" she says.  over five years, the suppressed trauma related to her friends deaths grew - she wasn't sleeping or eating properly.  ""i was doing quite a good job as a nurse, but actually it was all coming on top of me and then i just broke. i think it was nursing triggering that pain.""   hannah macdonald  hannah had been seeing a psychologist. but one session, before a shift, he showed concern.  ""he asked me if i'd ever thought of suicide and i said 'yes', and then he asked me if i'd done anything towards trying to do that and i went silent.""  he took her to the emergency psychiatric service where hannah was seen by a doctor for a mental health assessment. it was decided she needed to be detained under the mental health act.  ""that was just terrifying,"" she says. ""i didn't actually know what was happening to me. because i was a nurse people thought that i might understand, but i had no clue what was going on.""  she was taken to a secure unit at a london hospital. her nurses uniform still in her bag.  ""in that very first moment my whole world just fell apart. i remember just thinking 'that's it, i'm never going to be a nurse again'.""  her comfort, embroidery, was also confiscated - the scissors and needles deemed too dangerous.  hannah was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (bpd), which affects mood and how a person interacts with others. she believes it stemmed from the unresolved grief of her childhood.   hannah macdonald  according to the nhs, symptoms include emotional instability with often negative, suicidal, thoughts, impulsive behaviour such as self-harm and intense but unstable relationships.  ""you lose how you see yourself. you lose your hopes because you think who's going to want to have a relationship with me now? you then have to deal with the stigma, the self-stigma, but also the losses of physically going into hospital.  ""i was meeting people who had been in that system for 20 years and i just thought, 'this is now my life'.""  but there were moments of positivity.  when hannah was ""really unwell"" her friends at the royal school of needlework invited her to work on a ""secret project"".  ""i walked in and there was white lace everywhere. it was the duchess of cambridge's wedding dress. it was a wonderful, wonderful thing to work on.""  she spent eight days on the project which the world marvelled at.     afterwards, the duchess visited the craftspeople involved, but by then hannah had returned to the secure unit.  ""when i said that i'd worked on her dress one of the nurses actually thought i was deluded.  ""that actually was a really beautiful thing for me to work on at that time. it will go with me for the rest of my life.""  after five difficult years, hannah was referred to cassel hospital in west london, a therapeutic community where patients and therapists live alongside each other and contribute to everything - cooking, group therapy, even supporting each other through the night.  although she was sceptical, she found the peer support extraordinarily helpful - ""the patients understand more than the staff do sometimes"" - and credits that with her recovery.  it gave hannah the confidence to return to nursing - a two-year process.  some medics supported her, while others insisted she be assessed by a private psychiatrist. she found it infuriating that some nhs doctors questioned the validity of their own treatment.  ""i became really determined then, to show that people can come through serious mental illness.""  earlier this year, hannah was offered the job at a hospice. the start date was 11 march.  listen to more from hannah on the bbc ouch cabin fever podcast as she talks about her experience of the mental health system and her recovery.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption twelve years after being sectioned, hannah chose a tough time to return  for more disability news, follow bbc ouch on twitter and facebook, and subscribe to the podcast.  ""there was anxiety, but i just sort of went in and said 'i've come back to work after 12 years of illness'.  ""the lady who interviewed me really believed in me. she could see some of the skills that i'd learnt through my own illness could actually be really beneficial to palliative care.""  even though working with people who are close to the end of their life is difficult, hannah thrives in the environment.  ""there's something very beautiful about palliative care nursing - it's about trying to give what you can for families and patients in the last bit of their life. for me, it's realising it's not my pain.""  coronavirus has changed how hospices operate. only one visitor is allowed, celebrations like birthdays are on hold and staff wear ppe.  the past 12 years makes hannah worry what could await the general mental health of the country when this pandemic passes.  ""my mental illness was unresolved grief, where i didn't say goodbye,"" she says at a time when funerals and final moments are being by-passed or minimised due to lockdown restrictions.  ""i find that quite heart-breaking. as the years go on i think that will be some of the pain that is left behind by coronavirus.""  it's these wider concerns which make her want to tell her story.  and although it has been a long process, she achieved her goal, recovered, and returned to nursing."
health,"sweden's prime minister has admitted the country has not done enough to protect the elderly  care home residents account for nearly half of deaths linked to covid-19 in sweden. some healthcare workers believe an institutional reluctance to admit patients to hospital is costing lives.  lili sedghi's father, reza, was not seen by a doctor on the day he died from coronavirus, at his care home in northern stockholm.  a nurse told her he'd had a morphine shot in the hours before he passed away, but he was not given oxygen, nor did staff call an ambulance. ""no-one was there and he died alone,"" says ms sedghi. ""it's so unfair.""  most of the 3,698 people who have died from coronavirus in sweden so far were over 70, despite the fact that the country said shielding risk groups was its top priority.  sweden, with 10m inhabitants, has kept more of society open than is the case in most of europe.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption 'no one was there when my father died'  ""we did not manage to protect the most vulnerable people, the most elderly, despite our best intentions,"" prime minister stefan lÃ¶fven admitted last week.  the swedish public health agency told the bbc that 48.9% of deaths were care home residents up to and including 14 may.  sweden did ban visits to care homes on 31 march. but as in many european countries, relatives, staff and union officials have shared concerns that protective clothing arrived too late, and that some staff may have gone to work at the start of the crisis despite showing symptoms of covid-19.  now, increasing numbers of workers are also coming forward to criticise regional healthcare authorities for protocols which they say discourage care home workers from sending residents into hospital, and prevent care home and nursing staff from administering oxygen without a doctor's approval, either as part of acute or palliative (end-of-life) services.  'we were told not to send them in'  ""they told us that we shouldn't send anyone to the hospital, even if they may be 65 and have many years to live. we were told not to send them in,"" says latifa lÃ¶fvenberg, a nurse who worked in several care homes around gÃ¤vle, north of stockholm, at the beginning of the pandemic.  ""some can have a lot of years left to live with loved ones, but they don't have the chance... because they never make it to the hospital,"" she says. ""they suffocate to death. and it's a lot of panic and it's very hard to just stand by and watch.""   latifa lÃ¶fvenberg works as a nurse in stockholm  ms lÃ¶fvenberg is now working on a covid-19 ward in a major hospital in the swedish capital, where she says the demographic of patients she's treating is further evidence that the elderly are being kept away. ""we don't have many older people. it's a lot of younger people born in the 90s, 80s, 70s.""  a paramedic working in stockholm, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the bbc she had not had a single call-out to an elderly care home connected to covid-19, despite putting in overtime during the crisis.  mikael fjÃ¤llid, a swedish private consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care, says he believes ""a lot of lives"" could have been saved if more patients had been able to access hospital treatment, or if care home workers were given increased responsibilities to administer oxygen themselves, instead of waiting for specialist covid-19 response teams or paramedics.  ""if you need care and you can benefit [from] care, for example, or oxygen for a short time, you should have it. like any other age group in the population,"" says mr fjÃ¤llid, a right-wing critic of the centre-left led government.  ""if you have more than 20% that survive without nothing, you could assume that also perhaps the same amount or the same proportion would have survived with supplemental oxygen.""  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption swedish state epidemiologist anders tegnell argues swedenâ€™s strategy is largely working  in april 10,458 people died in sweden, making it the country's deadliest month since 1993, when there was an outbreak of seasonal flu, state-funded statistics sweden reports.  national guidelines  decisions about healthcare staffing and resources are taken at a regional level in sweden, although national guidelines suggest that elderly patients, whether in state or privately run care homes, should not automatically be taken to hospital for treatment.  dr thomas linden, chief medical officer at the national board of health and welfare, says workers should ""professionally weigh the potential benefits"" against risk factors such as catching the virus in hospital and the ""costs"" of transporting patients, including the likelihood of disorientation and discomfort.  healthcare workers are asked not to discriminate on age alone, he says, although biological age may be relevant in combination with other factors.  when it comes to providing palliative care, it is not mandatory to give patients oxygen, and dr linden admits ""the opinions on the value of oxygen is divided between specialities and regions"".  gÃ¤vleborg, the region where latifa lÃ¶fvenberg worked at the start of the pandemic, says individual patients' needs are always put first and that nurses can call doctors to make assessments about the need for hospital care.  it is against the idea of care-home workers administering oxygen during palliative care, because it requires specialist training.  christoffer bernskÃ¶ld, a spokesperson for geriatric care for region stockholm, insists there are enough resources to ensure patients in the capital get acute or palliative care, with a focus on ""specialist homecare units"" providing help in the first instance.     most swedish victims of the virus have been over 70 years old  he points to a new, unused, military field hospital in southern stockholm as proof that the elderly are not being held back from treatment because of a lack of beds.  but he says it can be an ""ethical dilemma"" whether to administer oxygen or transfer patients to hospital.  critics like mikael fjÃ¤llid see that field hospital as a sign that officials in the capital have been cautious about hospitalising the elderly because they fear overstretching resources, which would be needed to cope with a future spike in cases.  how do other countries prioritise patients?  sweden is not alone in asking healthcare workers to consider the fragility of patients when deciding whether or not to send them to hospital.  but representatives of care homes in other parts of europe have told the bbc they do not share swedish critics' concerns about a lack of access to treatment.  in the uk, the national care association says it believes care has been available for covid-19 patients ""no matter how old or sick"" they are.  the association of german aid for the elderly and disabled says every patient with coronavirus symptoms is seen by a doctor and there hasn't been a single patient who has not received the care they needed. in some cases, entire care homes have been moved into hospitals. many homes also keep emergency oxygen on site.  the danish nurses association says that all patients in need of oxygen are currently sent to hospital. this could be reviewed if there is a shortage of ventilators, although age would not affect future guidelines.  more funding and permanent jobs  at a recent news conference, sweden's prime minister stefan lÃ¶fven told the bbc that regional authorities had been trusted to make sure healthcare provision ""works the best way"" and given extra resources from the state to cover costs connected to covid-19.  last week the government also announced a further 2.2bn kronor (Â£185m) for additional training within care homes, with a view to creating 10,000 permanent positions for assistant nurses and care workers.  mr lÃ¶fven said it wasn't currently the right time to reflect on potential failures, but a national commission would look at how things had been handled at a local, regional and national level as soon as the ""acute"" phase of the crisis was over.  that is a bittersweet message for relatives of covid-19 victims like lili sedghi, who buried her father last week.  ""whatever they did didn't work, because... many, many people in his home are dead,"" she says.  additional reporting by sira thierij."
health,"the first hints that a vaccine can train people's immune system to fight coronavirus have been reported by a company in the us.  moderna said neutralising antibodies were found in the first eight people who took part in their safety trials.  it also said the immune response was similar to that in people infected with the actual virus.  larger trials to see whether the jab protects against infection are expected to start in july.  work on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed, with around 80 groups around the world working on them.  moderna was the first to test an experimental vaccine, called mrna-1273, in people.  the vaccine is a small snippet of the coronavirus's genetic code, which is injected into the patient.  it is not capable of causing an infection or the symptoms of covid-19, but is enough to provoke a response from the immune system.  the vaccine trials, run by the us government's national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, showed the vaccine led to the production of antibodies which can neutralise the coronavirus.  however, testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial.  the people on the trial were taking either a low, middle or high dose. the highest dose was linked to most side-effects.  however, moderna said that even people taking the lowest dose had antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from covid-19.  and antibodies ""significantly exceeded"" those in recovered patients for people on the middle dose.  the study is known as a phase 1 trial as it is designed to test whether the vaccine is safe, rather then whether it is effective.  it will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. however, experiments on mice showed the vaccine could prevent the virus replicating in their lungs.  ""these interim phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mrna-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection,"" said dr tal zaks, chief medical officer at moderna.  ""these data substantiate our belief that mrna-1273 has the potential to prevent covid-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials.""  moderna said it was hoping to start a large-scale trial in july, and that it was already investigating how to manufacture the vaccine at scale.  oxford vaccine  a vaccine pioneered by the university of oxford is also being tested in people, but there are no results from those trials yet.  however, concerns have been raised about the results of experiments in monkeys.  tests showed vaccinated animals had less severe symptoms and did not get pneumonia. however, they were not completely protected from the virus and signs of it were detected at the same level in the monkeys' noses as in unvaccinated animals.  prof eleanor riley, from the university of edinburgh, said: ""if similar results were obtained in humans, the vaccine would likely provide partial protection against disease in the vaccine recipient but would be unlikely to reduce transmission in the wider community.""  however, until human trials have been performed it is impossible to know how the vaccine will perform in people.  follow james on twitter"

sport,ireland 21-19 argentina an injury-time dropped goal by ronan o gara stole victory for ireland from underneath the noses of argentina at lansdowne road on saturday.  o gara kicked all of ireland s points  with two dropped goals and five penalties  to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. an impressive argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. the pumas shocked the irish early on with a try from federico aramburu  and felipe contepomi kicked 14 points. the well-drilled and sharper pumas out-played and out-thought ireland in the early stages. indiscipline allowed argentina s leinster fly-half contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. he was on the mark again two minutes later when argentina shocked a ragged ireland with the first try of the game. ireland turned the ball over and manuel contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner aramburu to sprint in under the posts. o gara finally got ireland on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. playing into a strong wind and rain  ireland continued to come second best in tight situations  and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. o gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute  but once again contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. the second-half started as the first had ended. o gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute  but contepomi matched it three minutes later. the upper-body strength of the pumas never allowed ireland to take control up front  while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. ireland had to rely on o gara s boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. the munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. and ireland s chance came when argentina s number eight gonzalo longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. o gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. but ireland showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow o gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous  if fortuitous  comeback.

sport,hantuchova in dubai last eight daniela hantuchova moved into the quarter-finals of the dubai open  after beating elene likhotseva of russia 7-5 6-4  and now faces serena williams.  australian open champion williams survived an early scare to beat russia s elena bovina 1-6 6-1 6-4. world number one lindsay davenport and anastasia myskina also progressed. davenport defeated china s jie zheng 6-2 7-5  while french open champion myskina sailed through after her opponent marion bartoli retired hurt. american davenport will now face fellow former wimbledon champion  conchita martinez of spain  who ousted seventh-seeded nathalie dechy of france 6-1 6-2. myskina will face eighth-seed patty schnyder from switzerland  who defeated china s li na 6-3 7-6 (10-8). the other quarter final pits wild card sania mirza of india against jelena jankovic of serbia and montenegro  who both won on tuesday.  before her meeting with martinez  davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game.  i started well and finished well  but played some so-so games in the middle   she said. williams was also far from content.  i don t know what i was doing there   she said.  it was really windy and i hadn t played in the wind. all my shots were going out of here.  but hantuchova is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger williams sister  who was handed a first-round bye.  i feel i have an advantage (over serena) because i have already played two matches on these courts   she said.  it is a difficult court to play on. very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball.
sport,melzer shocks agassi in san jose second seed andre agassi suffered a comprehensive defeat by jurgen melzer in the quarter-finals of the sap open.  agassi was often bamboozled by the austrian s drop shots in san jose  losing 6-3 6-1. defending champion and top seed andy roddick rallied to beat sweden s thomas enqvist 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-5. but unseeded cyril saulnier beat the fourth seed vincent spadea 6-2 6-4 and tommy haas overcame eighth seed max mirnyi 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-2. melzer has now beaten agassi in two of their three meetings.   i had a good game plan and i executed it perfectly   he said.  it s always tough to come out to play andre.  i didn t want him to play his game. he makes you run like a dog all over the court.  and agassi  who was more than matched for power by his opponent s two-handed backhand  said melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him.  a lot more guys are capable of it now   said the american.  he played much better than me. that s what he did both times.  i had opportunities to loosen myself up   agassi added.  but i didn t convert on the big points.
sport,hewitt overcomes wobble in sydney lleyton hewitt gave himself the perfect preparation for next week s australian open with victory over ivo minar in the final of the sydney international.  the defending champion brushed aside the czech qualifier 7-5 6-0. the australian world number three strolled to the first five games of the match but was shocked as minar won the next five. the top seed was rattled but recovered to close out the set and raced to victory in exactly an hour.  it was a strange match . . . momentum swings   said hewitt.  i felt like i came out of the blocks extremely well  but then he loosened up a bit.  when he got back to 5-5  i had to try to settle down and take it up a notch  and i was able to do that.   hewitt has now lifted the sydney title four times in the last six years.  it just keeps getting better and better every year   hewitt said.  i ve only played this tournament four times and i ve won it four times.  hewitt went into the final as a short-priced favourite to clinch his 24th career title after dropping only one set all week. he is set to meet frenchman arnaud clement in the first round of the australian open. minar  ranked 158th in the world  was forced to pull out of the australian open qualifying draw to play in his first atp final.  for me  this was a big success   said the 20-year-old.  i was so nervous last night i couldn t sleep. i ve never played a top-10 player before.  i wanted to play qualifying in melbourne  but it s saturday and i m still here. but this is a main draw and i need the points and the money.  alicia molik takes on samantha stosur in an all-australian women s final later on saturday.

sport,ferguson urges henry punishment sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal s thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze.  ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united s controversial win. the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy s foul on ashley cole for which he got a three-game ban.  we shall present it to the fa and see what they do. the tackle on heinze was terrible   he said. clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. the clash occurred moments before half-time when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline. henry  following the ball  attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinze s head.  the striker protested his innocence - and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental. ferguson was also upset by arsenal s overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side s behaviour.  edu produced a terrible tackle on scholes that was a potential leg-breaker   he said.  there were 24 fouls in the game by arsenal  seven on heinze  five on ronaldo  six by vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. phil neville got booked for his first challenge.  i am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure.  we have always been good at being gracious in defeat. what happened on sunday overshadowed our achievement  but then they do it all the time  don t they
politics,tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner  under plans unveiled by the conservatives.  party leader michael howard said the new role would replace  inconspicuous  police authorities. he said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. the lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing  while labour criticised  extravagant  tory promises on policing.  responding to the plans  the chairman of the police federation of england and wales  which represents rank and file officers  said it was essential operational independence was retained.  jan berry said:  it is a service  not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches.  these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground   she warned. outlining his crime manifesto  mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates.  the commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have   he told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  the trouble is  and it s no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are.  mr howard said the authorities were not  providing the local accountability that we want to see  and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.  critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. lord harris  who sits on the executive of association of police authorities  said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician.  that is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions   he said.  liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and  could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials . mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a  minimum policing guarantee  with their chief constables. a labour party spokesman criticised michael howard s record  saying police numbers had fallen by 1 132 when he was home secretary. he said:  today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them  other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system.  the tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an american sheriff. other tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.
politics,howard pitches for uk ethnic vote michael howard is to make a pitch for britain s ethnic vote urging people who feel  taken for granted  by tony blair to vote conservative.  he will say conservatives  share the same values  as the uk s minorities. and that he wants to build a  better britain  where everyone  whatever the colour of their skin or religion  can  make the most of their talents . but the tory leader will argue against positive discrimination saying it is  outdated and unjust .   it sets family against family and it leads ethnic communities to doubt their own abilities   he will argue. mr howard - himself the son of immigrants - will acknowledge that racial discrimination still exists in the uk.  people from ethnic communities  for example  still earn less than their white counterparts   he will say before arguing the answer to helping everyone to get on was  free enterprise  free trade  free speech . the tory leader will also call for religious tolerance arguing that hindus and sikhs as well as muslims got  caught in the downdraft of islamaphobia which was one of the terrible side effects of 9/11 .  mr howard will make his speech during a visit to support tory parliamentary hopefuls robert light and sayeeda warsi -  the first british muslim woman  selected to run for mp as a conservative candidate. he will attack labour s record in government over issues such as tax and he will set out tory plans for an immigration quota to be set by mps. mr howard will also attack the lib dems for wanting to abolish faith schools  introduce compulsory sex education from the age of seven  and  give contraceptives out in schools from the age of 11 .  so i say to all those people from ethnic minorities who feel mr blair and the liberal democrats take their votes for granted - come join us   he will say. lib dem president simon hughes branded mr howard  arrogant and wrong  for claiming the tories were the  natural party  for britain s ethnic minorities.  given the tories  considerably reduced support in urban areas  where many black and asian britons live  during their time in power  the evidence simply does not support his claims that the conservatives are the party for these communities   he said.
politics,clarke to press on with id cards new home secretary charles clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for id cards despite a call for him to  pause for thought  from charles kennedy.  the lib dem leader said david blunkett s resignation was a  good opportunity  to question whether the legislation was necessary. but mr clarke said he had supported the plans when mr blunkett argued for them in cabinet and he supported them now.  id cards are a means to creating a more secure society   he said. mr clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been  significantly influenced  by the recommendations of the commons  home affairs committee.  the issue would be debated in parliament next monday as scheduled he insisted. earlier mr kennedy  whose party opposes the id cards plan as  deeply flawed  said with christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme that mr clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about id cards than his predecessors.  wouldn t this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary  a new broom  to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place   he asked. earlier this week the tories announced they would back the government s plans although michael howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.  they had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror  crime and illegal immigration. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis  oliver letwin and tim yeo. the chairman of the bar council  guy mansfield qc has warned there is a real risk that people on the  margins of society  would be driven into the hands of extremists.  what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere  they are going to be stopped. if they haven t [id cards] they are going to be detained.   the home office says people will pay Â£85 for a passport and id card together or a undecided fee for a separate id card. the first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill  mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards  although not to carry them. the new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. and there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to Â£1 000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to Â£2 500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory. the scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog.
politics,boris opposes mayor apology ken livingstone should  stick to his guns  and not apologise for his  nazi  comment to a jewish reporter  tory mp boris johnson has insisted.  mr johnson also claimed tony blair s intervention in the row was  an attempt to reassure jewish voters . london mayor mr livingstone says he is  standing by  his remarks which likened an evening standard journalist to a  concentration camp guard . but the prime minister says it is time for mr livingstone to say sorry.  labour s mr livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist  and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if mr blair asked. later the prime minister said:  a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time  but in the circumstances  and to the journalist because he was a jewish journalist  yes  he should apologise.   however  mr johnson  who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about liverpudlians grieving over the death of british hostage ken bigley  said mr blair  should butt out of  the row.  i don t see why the prime minister has to get involved in this   the spectator editor told bbc radio 4 s today programme.  it s a dispute between ken livingstone and a reporter on the evening standard.  mr johnson  mp for henley-on-thames  oxfordshire  said he suspected labour was now trying to reassure jewish voters  because of this curious way in which labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war .   ken doesn t think he s got anything to say sorry for and if that s really his feeling  then i think that he should stick to his guns   he said. mr johnson apologised last october for perpetuating an  outdated stereotype  of liverpool in the leader article on the death of mr bigley. the article in the magazine suggested grieving liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status. it also attributed blame to drunken liverpool football fans for the 1989 hillsborough disaster in which 96 died. mr johnson told today:  it s perfectly true that i got into the grovelling game myself and when i apologised there were some things that i felt i ought to say sorry for ... there were also other things i didn t think i should apologise for   he said.  but here s old ken - he s been crass  he s been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language - but i don t think actually if you read what he said  although it was extraordinary and rude  i don t think he was actually anti-semitic.
politics,could rivalry overshadow election  tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.  along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues  they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain. it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift. ian gibson  for example  urged the two men to stop squabbling  declaring:  for goodness sake  sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can.  those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re-election. tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.  meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue. and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison. lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning.  but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage. they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears. and it matters little whether the rift is real or  as some try to suggest  simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip. few in westminster actually believe that  simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.  for example  the weekend s attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick. even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories  they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments.  mr blair talked about the  new  labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor  who has long rejected the label. and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year. that claim was repeated in robert peston s book  a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act.  for his part  mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re-elected.  the trouble is  both men have fallen short of offering simple  straightforward denials of the central claims. so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour. the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere. they started with and are sustained by  friends  of the two men. one only had to listen to the chancellor s friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister s apparent attempts to confound mr brown s leadership ambitions. but it is not just public pronouncements from ex-aides.  there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides. it is no secret in westminster  for example  that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner.  then there are the actions of the men themselves. gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign. the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor. meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter  which they believe is a media-only obsession  or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. either way  there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage. there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation. but with probably only four months to the next election  that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off.
sport,mcleish ready for criticism rangers manager alex mcleish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous uefa cup exit at the hands of auxerre at ibrox on wednesday.  mcleish told bbc radio five live:  we were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it  we absolutely blew it.  there s no use burying your head in the sand  we know we are going to get a lot of criticism.  we have to take it as we have done in the past and we must now bounce back.  mcleish admitted his team s defending was amateurish after watching them lose 2-0 to guy roux s french side.   i m very disappointed because we didn t give ourselves a chance  losing the first goal from our own corner. it was amateur   he added.  the early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half.  it s difficult to take positives from the game. we ve let the fans down.
sport,premier league planning cole date the premier league is attempting to find a mutually convenient date to investigate allegations chelsea made an illegal approach for ashley cole.  both chelsea and arsenal will be asked to give evidence to a premier league commission  but no deadline has been put on when that meeting will convene.  it s hard to put a date on it   a premier league spokesman confirmed to bbc sport.  it s not a formal situation where they ve got so much time to respond.  arsenal and england defender cole reportedly met blues boss jose mourinho and chief executive peter kenyon in a london hotel 11 days ago. chelsea have yet to officially confirm or deny the meeting  which would be in breach of premier league rule k3.  now the gunners have asked for an inquiry to look into claims that their player has been  tapped up . both clubs have pledged to co-operate with the inquiry which will be conducted on a single day as opposed to being run as an ongoing evaluation. cole is in negotiations with the gunners over extending his current deal which ends in 2007. and his arsenal team-mate robert pires has urged the england left-back to stay at highbury. pires told the evening standard:  he has been at arsenal for ever. he is a very attacking left-back and i think he is enjoying his football because at arsenal he plays in an offensive team.  i am not sure he will get the same pleasure at chelsea  even though they are doing so well at the moment.  i have built a fantastic playing relationship with ashley.  we play together so well - we could do it with our eyes shut.  but you have to respect the decision of the player. everybody has that right.
health,"being obese is known to increase the risk of a number of diseases, including heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes.  early research suggests it may also make people more ill with covid-19, but why is this the case?  is there evidence obesity is a risk for the virus?  this question has been the subject of many studies as experts try to work out the answer.  in a study of nearly 17,000 hospital patients with covid-19 in the uk, those who were obese - with a body mass index (bmi) of more than 30 - had a 33% greater risk of dying than those who were not obese.  a separate study of nhs electronic health records found a doubling of the risk of dying from covid-19 among people who were obese. if other health conditions linked to obesity such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes were also taken into account the risk would be even higher, the researchers said.  and a study of critically ill patients in uk intensive care units found that nearly 34.5% were overweight, 31.5% were obese and 7% morbidly obese (a total of 73%), compared to 26% with a healthy bmi.  these figures compare to 64% overweight and obese in the uk population - 35% with a bmi of 25-29 and 29% with a bmi of 30 or higher.  body mass index is calculated as someone's weight in kilograms divided by their height in metres squared.  given high rates of global obesity, the world obesity federation says a high percentage of people who contract coronavirus ""will also have a bmi over 25"". early studies from the us, italy and china also suggest it is an important risk factor.  ageing, being a man and underlying health issues all increase the risk of becoming more seriously ill from covid-19.  why is being obese a risk?  the more overweight you are, the more fat you're carrying, the less fit you are and the lower your lung capacity. this means it is a bigger struggle to get oxygen into the blood and around the body. this impacts on the heart and blood flow too.  ""because people are more overweight, they also have a demand for more oxygen. so that means their system is actually undergoing greater pressure,"" says prof naveed sattar, from the university of glasgow.  during an infection like coronavirus, this can be serious.  ""eventually the obese body becomes overwhelmed by the lack of oxygen getting to the major organs,"" says dr dyan sellayah, from the university of reading.  that is one reason why overweight and obese people in intensive care are more likely to need assistance with breathing and support with kidney function.     what role do fat cells play?  scientists have discovered that an enzyme called ace2, present in cells, is the main way for the virus to enter the body.  higher levels of this molecule are thought to be found in adipose tissue, or fatty tissue, which people who are obese have more of - under the skin and around their organs.  that could be one reason they have a higher risk of catching the disease and a higher risk of being ill with it.  is the immune system affected too?  on top of everything else, the ability of the body to fight off the virus - known as the immune response - is not as good in people who are obese.  that's due to inflammation driven by immune cells called macrophages which invade our fat tissue. they interfere with how our cells respond to infection.  according to scientists, this can lead to a 'cytokine storm' - a potentially life-threatening over-reaction of the body's immune system which causes inflammation and serious harm.  a specific type of fat tissue is prone to macrophage invasion. this may explain why people from black, african and ethnic minority backgrounds (bame), who have more of this type of tissue, ""have elevated rates of diabetes, and may be more vulnerable to the virus,"" dr sellayah says.     could there be other hidden problems?  obesity often comes with other health issues, such as a weak heart or lungs, a poorly-functioning kidney or type 2 diabetes.  this may not come to light until the development of a severe infection such as covid-19 and they all put extra stress on the body.  blood clots are also more likely to develop, but it's not clear why.  what about hospital care?  there can be challenges when it comes to managing patients with obesity in intensive care because it is more difficult to intubate them, and to scan them because of weight limits.  heavier patients may also be more tricky to turn, or prone, in order to relieve their breathing.  what can i do to be healthy?  the best way is to eat a healthy, balanced diet and exercise regularly.  fast walking, jogging and cycling are good options, even with social distancing measures in force.  otherwise, try to eat slowly and avoid situations where you could be tempted to overeat."
health,"there is a simple but crucial number at the heart of understanding the threat posed by the coronavirus. it is guiding governments around the world on the actions needed to save lives and to lift lockdown.  it is called the reproduction number, or simply the r value.  what is r?  the reproduction number is a way of rating a disease's ability to spread.  it's the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average  measles has one of the highest numbers in town with a reproduction number of 15 in populations without immunity. it can cause explosive outbreaks.  the new coronavirus, known officially as sars-cov-2, has a reproduction number of about three, but estimates vary.  how is r calculated?  you cannot capture the moment people are infected; instead scientists work backwards.  using data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus - allows you to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.  generally this gives a picture of what the r number was two to three weeks ago. regular testing of households should soon give a more timely estimate.  why is a number above one dangerous?  if the reproduction number is higher than one, then the number of cases increases exponentially - it snowballs like debt on an unpaid credit card.  but if the number is lower, the disease will eventually peter out, as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.   if the r-value is above one then the number of cumulative cases takes off, but if it is below one then eventually the outbreak stops. the further below one, the faster that happens.  governments everywhere want to force the reproduction number down from about three (the r number if we took no action) to below one.  this is the reason you've not seen family, have had to work from home and the children have been off school - stopping people coming into contact with each other to cut the virus's ability to spread.  what is the r number in the uk?  the reproduction number is not fixed. instead, it changes as our behaviour changes, or as immunity develops.  mathematical modellers at imperial college london are attempting to track how the number has changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced.  before any measures came in, the number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one.  the r value in the uk has crept up recently and is now thought to be between 0.7 and 1.0.  counter-intuitively, this increase is probably due to the success in slowing the virus in society as a whole. as cases collapse in the community, the r value is largely reflecting what is happening in care homes.  does r vary across the uk?  the r number has come down across every part of the uk since the start of the epidemic.  but multiple research groups, including those at the university of cambridge, show it has come down the most in london. it is proving far more stubborn in the north-east of england.  those figures are more optimistic than other groups' calculations. similar work by the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine puts the number for london at 0.6, and the south-west at 0.9.  it also showed the r-values were 0.8 in wales, and 1 in both scotland and northern ireland.  so how does this inform lifting lockdown?  as any country thinks about how to lift lockdown, the aim will be to keep the reproduction number below one.  dr adam kucharski, of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, told the bbc: ""it's a big challenge making sure you're not loosening too much and increasing transmission.""  however it has taken a monumental effort, one that has caused damage to people's lives, to get the number from three to 0.7.  ""it doesn't give you a lot of room to play with [to keep the number below one]"", dr kucharski added.  which measures could be lifted?  unfortunately, there is no confirmation of how much each intervention affects the virus's spread, although there are estimates.  ""opening schools versus workplaces versus other gatherings - understanding how much they increase the reproduction number, is going to be the challenge,"" said dr kucharski.  another issue is that people's behaviour changes over time, so the number can creep up even if lockdown policies remain unchanged.  what is likely to be needed are new ways of controlling the virus, such as more extensive testing and tracing or location-tracking apps.  these can suppress the reproduction number in a more targeted way, allowing some of the other measures to be lifted.  is it the most important number?  the reproduction number is one of the big three.  another is severity - if you have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems, then you can relax a bit. coronavirus, and the disease it causes, covid-19, can be severe and deadly, unfortunately.  the last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. if you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases.  what about a vaccine?  having a vaccine is another way to bring down the reproduction number.  a coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.  follow james on twitter"
health,"coronavirus has forced people around the world to change the way they live their lives. in britain we have been spending most of our time at home, attempting to educate our own children and leaving the house only for essential reasons. what has kept us going? here are eight things british people have been doing to cope with life in lockdown.  1. socialising virtually  with almost half of britons (48%) reporting that their wellbeing has been affected by the coronavirus crisis, according to the uk's office for national statistics (ons), large numbers of us have been forced into finding new coping strategies.  probably unsurprisingly, top of the list of things people say are helping them is staying in touch with friends and family.  almost eight in 10 respondents (78%) cite contacting important people in their lives over the phone, social media or video conferencing as a key factor in coping while being at home, according to ons survey data collected at the end of april.  and individuals have also been flocking to a variety of platforms to stay in touch.  britons are spending more time on social media, with almost half (47%) doing so, according to polling from ipsos mori.  and video-conferencing tool zoom and video-chat app houseparty have seen huge rises in take-up.  zoom says its global daily users went from around 10 million in december last year to a massive 300 million in april, while houseparty has revealed that its app has seen 50 million sign-ups.  people have also been using the internet to continue with other social activities, such as taking part in virtual worship services. more than half of respondents (52%) to the ons survey said they had used digital services in this way.  however, with many of us now relying on the internet for work, social life and entertainment, charities have warned that lockdown has left some of the uk's poorest people shut out of such support networks.  according to 2017 figures from ofcom, only 47% of those on low incomes have broadband internet at home.  the addressing poverty with lived experience (aple) collective, a grassroots network of people with experience of living in poverty, has asked the government to introduce free wi-fi for vulnerable low-income groups.  2. watching films and using streaming services  the second most popular way britons have been coping, according to ons data, has been by viewing on screens.  almost six in 10 people (57%) say they are watching films or using streaming services to help ease the impact of the crisis, according to the ons.  separate research by ipsos mori suggests households are watching more tv overall, with an average of five hours more each week being consumed than before lockdown.  the same survey also reveals families are watching more tv together, with shared viewing up by 37% year-on-year since restrictions began.  ""new routines and habits are emerging, with tv bringing households together to seek comfort in shared experiences,"" says ben page, chief executive of ipsos mori.  3. spending more time with the people we live with - and helping neighbours  more than half of britons (54%) say spending more time with the people in their household has helped them cope, according to the ons.  but it is not only the closeness of those we live with that is easing the effects of the lockdown, some people have also found solace in their neighbourhoods.  community spirit has also grown, ons data suggests, with eight in 10 adults (80%) saying they think people are doing more to help others than before the pandemic began.  but while for some, spending more time with family is helping them survive, for others being in a confined space for long periods of time under high levels of stress is compounding existing problems.  a report by mps on the home affairs select committee has revealed a ""surge"" in violence in the weeks after lockdown was introduced, with a rise in killings and the number of calls to the national domestic abuse helpline run by refuge up 49% after three weeks.  the nspcc, which has been awarded Â£1.6m in government funding, has also reported a spike in demand since the crisis began, with its helpline providing almost 3,000 counselling sessions linked to the outbreak of coronavirus between late january and mid-april.  4. exercising outside and in  about half of us (52%) find exercising outside helps us cope under the current conditions, while almost one in three of us (31%) find indoor workouts beneficial, ons survey data suggests.  there are also indications that some people might be exercising more than before, with separate ipsos mori polling finding that a quarter (25%) have upped their activity levels since restrictions were imposed.  the popularity of virtual classes has soared.  body coach joe wicks claimed a guinness world record after one of his online fitness classes was watched by nearly a million people - the most viewers for a workout live-stream on youtube.  such exercise is not only keeping people fit though, experts say, it can help us deal with the crisis itself.  ""exercise has a dramatic anti-depressive effect,"" explains david linden, professor of neuroscience at johns hopkins university. ""it blunts the brain's response to physical and emotional stress.""  5. cooking, gardening and reading  more than four in 10 britons are turning to cooking, gardening or reading (45%, 42%, 44%) - or all three - to help deal with current restrictions, according to the ons.  news that many of us have turned to baking may not come as a surprise, with supermarket shelves stripped of flour since march.  british grocers saw a 92% increase in purchasing of flour in the four weeks to 22 march, according to consumer research company kantar. that's an extra 2.1 million people who bought flour in those four weeks compared with the year before.  there has been a surge in demand for baking ingredients overall, kantar's analysts say, with sales of suet up by 115% and sugar by 46% in the month to 22 april. more than 40% of the consumers polled by the company say they are doing more home-baking now than before lockdown.  but along with baking ingredients, people are also craving instruction. demand for bread recipes rose dramatically on the bbc good food website in april, with all the top-10-viewed videos relating to baking or bread. nine of the highest rising recipes were also bread-related, with traffic to ""easy soda bread"" increasing 2,700% on last year.  ""the motion of stirring, beating and kneading can be meditative and the results are very rewarding, which is why we are seeing a surge in people wanting to learn new baking skills,"" suggests lily barclay, editor of bbcgoodfood.com.  as well as cooking, gardening has also proved popular, with seed companies across the uk reporting huge spikes in sales at the beginning of lockdown, with some halting new orders altogether.  since then, the royal horticultural society (rhs) says it has seen hundreds of thousands more people use its gardening advice pages compared with last year.  over the past few weeks, a third of a million britons searched for tips on how to grow potatoes, tomatoes and strawberries at home, while traffic to compost pages has increased by nearly 500% on the previous year, the rhs says.  6. doing diy and learning something new  with some britons in lockdown now having more time on their hands, almost a third (32%) are using those extra hours to do diy tasks and more than one in 10 (14%) are learning something new, according to the ons.  the internet is awash with guides on upskilling, from home improvements, languages and instruments to dance, crafts and coding.  but other platforms awarding official qualifications have also reported a surge in enrolments, such as those providing ""massive open online courses"", or moocs, such as edx, futurelearn and coursera.  many, including the world economic forum, believe this shift away from the classroom towards educational technology, or ""edtech"", among all ages could well have changed the way we all learn and educate ourselves forever.  7. spending more on food and shopping locally  new lockdown routines mean britons are also changing shopping habits, placing more importance on food and cooking at home.  figures from kantar show shoppers spent Â£524m more on groceries in the month to 22 april than last year - despite the fact that the number of supermarket visits fell.  the rise is primarily down to changing habits, analysts say, as people adapt to a new way of living, with people eating fewer meals out of the house.  people are also turning to their local shops to buy essentials, with convenience stores seeing an almost 40% increase in sales, kantar says.  however, not everyone is able to afford the food they and their family need.  the trussell trust reported an 81% increase in need for emergency food parcels from food banks during the last two weeks of march compared with the same period in 2019. it was the organisation's busiest period ever.  8. spending more on home comforts - such as potpourri, scented candles and logs for fires  as well as taking solace in food, there also are signs people have been purchasing comfort items - in a bid to create a safe haven within our own four walls, perhaps.  for example, sales of scented candles and potpourri were up 36% in the four weeks to 22 march compared with last year, figures from kantar show.  sales of logs and firelighters were also up by 36%, kantar says, again suggesting creating a snug home environment has become a priority for many.  such changes in behaviour and buying habits may be why, coming to the end of our seventh week living under restrictions, there are signs many of us may not actually want to go back to our old ways at all.  yougov polling suggests fewer than one in 10 people (9%) actually want life to return to ""normal"" after the coronavirus outbreak is over.  design by irene de la torre arenas, gerry fletcher and zoe bartholomew."
health,"as a precaution, pregnant women have been told to be particularly strict about avoiding social contact, so they reduce their risk of catching coronavirus. but what do we know about its impact on pregnancy?  is coronavirus a problem during my pregnancy?  although there is still much that doctors don't know about how pregnancy can be affected by the virus, pregnant women do not appear to become more unwell than other healthy adults who contract it.  ""if there were huge risks, we would have seen them by now,"" says christoph lees, professor of obstetrics at imperial college london.  like the general population, if they are infected, the vast majority of pregnant women will have mild or moderate symptoms and recover. these include cough, fever, shortness of breath, headache and loss of sense of smell.  coronavirus can be a problem in pregnancy if women become seriously ill with covid-19 - but that is very rare.  pregnant women with serious heart problems are in a very high-risk group and are recommended to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact. they should contact doctors about their care.  some viruses are worse in pregnant women, but there is no evidence this is the case for this coronavirus.  what did recent uk research find?  early research based on 427 pregnant women admitted to hospitals in the uk with covid-19 found most were more than six months pregnant, stressing the importance of social distancing in the third trimester.  pregnant women from ethnic minority backgrounds, older women and those who were overweight or obese were more likely to need hospital treatment for the lung disease, data from the uk obstetric surveillance system. found.  the majority of the women gave birth safely, although one in 10 required intensive care. fewer than 20 babies were born before 32 weeks.  scientists are studying the experiences of pregnant women through the pan-covid pregnancy and neonatal registry.  women can give their views on being pregnant during the pandemic in a survey by the university of east anglia.  is there a risk of my baby being born prematurely?  some reports are emerging of babies being born early to women who were very ill with the coronavirus - but it's hard to know the reason for delivery.  ""where a reason is given, it may be due to signs of distress in the baby or to allow better treatment for low oxygen levels in the woman,"" says dr ed mullins, from queen charlotte's and chelsea hospital, london.  during pregnancy, a growing baby places some pressure on the lungs, heart and circulation of its mother. being seriously ill with covid-19 could make this situation worse and cause breathing difficulties.  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption coronavirus: ""pregnancy during a pandemic is terrifying""  any woman in this position would be watched extremely closely in hospital.  ""acute illnesses which cause fever can be associated with premature labour and birth,"" says prof marian knight, professor of maternal and child population health from the university of oxford.  however, she said most premature births have been because of early caesareans in women with covid-related breathing problems, rather than because of premature labour starting.  there is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage if women become infected.     can i pass the virus to my baby during pregnancy?  this is possible. there have been reports of a small number of cases, but the newborns were discharged from hospital and are well.  a study from china found three out of 33 babies born to mothers with covid-19 were infected.  it is difficult to work out if the babies were infected in the uterus, during labour or soon after birth, when a newborn is likely to have had close contact with the mum.  there is no evidence of the virus causing problems with a baby's development, says the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists (rcog).  what should i do if i'm pregnant and think i have the virus?  if you have cold or flu-like symptoms, you should stay at home for seven days.  if you've got any routine appointments in that time, you should let your midwife, antenatal clinic or maternity unit know about your symptoms.  most women will have mild symptoms which should go away in a few days.  but if you start feeling worse, you should contact your gp, the nhs via 111 (or nhs 24 in scotland), your maternity unit or 999 in an emergency.  the rcog has lots more advice on its website for pregnant women and their families.  should i be working if i'm pregnant?  if you are pregnant and can work from home, you should.     if you are more than 28 weeks' pregnant, or have an underlying health condition, this is particularly important, as you should be avoiding unnecessary social contact.  women less than 28 weeks' pregnant can continue to work outside the home provided they take the necessary precautions, and stay 2m (6ft) away from other people.  advice for healthcare workers who are pregnant is to avoid caring for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection."
health,"media playback is unsupported on your device media caption coronavirus in scotland: the frontline in icu  the bbc has been granted exclusive access to university hospital monklands in airdrie, north lanarkshire, including the intensive care unit which has been at the centre of the struggle to save lives in the coronavirus pandemic.  day and night in intensive care the lights blaze, the monitors beep and the machines buzz.  it is bright and it is noisy but for the patients this is the twilight world, a place where the darkness deepens.  no-one wants to be here, far less to return, but nor do they have a choice.   john needed to be readmitted to intensive care  looking gaunt and ashen, john houston is being wheeled back in to the unit he left four days ago.  his kidneys are struggling to cope with covid-19 and he needs filtration treatment.  ""can't breathe,"" he mumbles as a nurse hooks him up to a jumble of clear plastic tubes and red, yellow and green cables.  a few minutes later john manages a few words, telling us how he was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago and had hoped to be back home with his beloved border collie, cody, by now.  the medication john has been given makes him hallucinate, he says, a common experience for patients in intensive care and one he describes as ""a bit scary"".  doctors here at monklands say the ubiquitous public health advice - to stay home, protect the nhs and save lives - has worked but they also warn that the first wave of infection to hit scotland is still washing ashore.  the number of coronavirus patients here has fallen sharply in the past couple of weeks but the average length of a stay in intensive care has risen during the pandemic.  many of those who remain are extremely sick and cases like john's, where patients need to be readmitted to the intensive care unit, are common.  on the day we filmed in monklands - friday 1 may - seven coronavirus patients died, the highest number the hospital had seen in any 24-hour period since the outbreak began.  in intensive care, we met senior nurse abigail mcsherry as she was putting together a pack of memories for the family of one patient who had just died.  among the items were a diary of the patient's time in the unit, a drawing of a tree based on his handprint and a pair of knitted hearts - one to go with the body, the other to be sent out to the man's family.  partners of patients are only allowed in the hospital under very limited circumstances, essentially for births and deaths. even then, to enter a covid ward, visitors have to don the same personal protective equipment (ppe) as staff - gloves, aprons, masks and visors.  ""his wife was here,"" says ms mcsherry of the man who had just died. ""it was very important because they'd spent their whole life together, from primary school right through. so, it was very important that we let her in.""  ""i got his wife to give his wee heart a kiss,"" she adds.  medical staff are used to dealing with death but that doesn't mean they don't feel its sting.   donna marie mcgroarty says the nurses are exhausted  ""the staff have had a difficult day today,"" says senior charge nurse donna marie mcgroarty.  ""we had a death this morning and then another death there, and that gentleman in particular has got no family,"" she says. ""so that's hard for them.""  as a gesture of compassion for a deceased patient who has no-one to mourn for them, she says, staff stand in respectful silence while the body is taken from the ward. ""that's just something that helps the staff get through this,"" she tells us.  ""we are exhausted,"" adds ms mcgroarty, ""we've been at this from maybe the second week, the third week of january.""  the coronavirus known as sars-cov-2 and the disease it causes, covid-19, came early to monklands because the hospital houses one of scotland's four regional infectious diseases units, with some of the first suspected cases in the country arriving in special ambulance transfers in early february, according to dr nick kennedy, a consultant in the unit.  the hospital's first positive case was confirmed early the following month.  ""it's a strange illness, the likes of which we've never seen before,"" he says.  the unusual virus prompted an unprecedented response, a wholesale transformation of this ageing district general hospital with one aim above all - increasing critical care capacity.  in just three weeks in february and march, says chief nurse karen goudie, monklands was fundamentally redesigned and restructured to handle covid-19.  ms goudie points out new walls, new barriers and new rooms as she explains how the entire building was divided into two separate pathways in an attempt to stop the coronavirus spreading - red for covid patients and the staff dealing with them; green for non-covid.  ""monklands is 40 years old,"" says chief of medical services dr rory mackenzie. ""we have advanced plans for a new hospital. the lack of single rooms is a real challenge for us in terms of managing some of these issues. so having a new hospital would have made this so much easier to deal with.""   dr sanjiv chohan says the health service has changed beyond recognition  instead, dr mackenzie and his team had to be creative. as one of the few areas with a plentiful supply of high-pressure oxygen, the infectious diseases unit was selected to become a high dependency unit (hdu) while the original hdu became an intensive care facility. operating theatres were converted to house intensive care beds.  before the pandemic monklands had the ability to ventilate five patients at any one time. at the peak, a few weeks ago, 15 patients were on ventilators and dr mackenzie says the hospital could now provide 20 ventilated beds if necessary.  for a while the hospital was running three separate intensive care units instead of one. it is now down to two: one red, one green.  ""this is not the health service we had two months ago. this is a different health service,"" says lead intensive care consultant dr sanjiv chohan.  maintaining such a high level of critical care capacity is putting enormous demands on staff and resources.  ""i don't think it's sustainable,"" cautions monklands' head of emergency medicine dr fiona hunter.   dr fiona hunter postponed her wedding to continue the fight against covid-19  these days dr hunter oversees, in effect, two accident and emergency departments - again, one red for covid patients, one green for non-covid - a situation she believes must persist while the virus remains prevalent in the population.  for now that means two senior consultants on site at all times, rather than one. it means double the number of reception staff. it means more expensive equipment and the cancellation of leave.  for dr hunter it even meant postponing her own wedding, which should have taken place on 28 march, when she and her fiance realised the best man would not be able to fly into scotland from france because of the pandemic. it was a difficult decision, she says, but ""the right thing to do"".  ""it allowed me to be freed up to really help with the fight in this department against covid,"" she says.  it's not just the emergency department which is feeling the strain. elsewhere in the hospital, physiotherapists and nurses who usually work in day surgery, operating theatres and the endoscopy unit have been seconded to intensive care.  at the same time the demand for some of those services has risen. many covid-19 patients have intense fatigue and continue to require a great deal of help with rehabilitation, says kirstin cleary, a specialist physiotherapist who has been working in intensive care.  ""even though we're past the peak there's going to be a massive impact on physiotherapy services, social care services and services in the community because these patients are going to need a lot of rehab to help them recover from this,"" she says.  right now the dilemma for monklands is that it simply cannot handle its normal patient traffic while it is configured for a pandemic and yet if there is ""recrudescence"" - another outbreak - intensive care may be overwhelmed again.  ""i think we're over the worst of this current outbreak, and undoubtedly we've seen that in terms of the figures that come through the hospital,"" says dr kennedy in the infectious diseases unit.  ""the trouble is, of course, we don't have an effective treatment. we don't have a vaccine. and so there is every risk that we could have a second wave,"" he adds.  it's not just here. managers across the nhs are now grappling with the challenge of how to maintain critical care at a safe level while also preparing for an expected rise in emergency admissions as the lockdown eases, and the return of patients with other serious illnesses, whose absence during the past couple of months has apparently led to a rise in preventable deaths from heart attacks, strokes and other causes.  ""the overall occupancy of the hospital has been down,"" explains dr mackenzie, and while ""that has made it easier to cope with the covid patients, the main concern we've got is there are patients who need health care [who] haven't been attending the hospital.""   matthew weir says he waited too long to seek treatment for a lung infection  matthew weir from coatbridge is one of them. he is being treated in the infectious diseases unit for a lung infection. it's a fate that matthew, 34, could probably have avoided had he not put off seeking medical help because of his fears about catching the coronavirus.  ""if i'm honest i probably left it a little bit too long, which is why i ended up staying here rather than it just being treated with antibiotics in the first place,"" he says.  dr hunter, in the emergency department, says the pandemic is forcing a rapid reassessment of the balance between providing services in hospital and in the community.  she says the hospital has set up a line for paramedics to seek ""advice and perhaps a bit of back-up"" from consultants on when a patient can safely be cared for in the community, perhaps in a clinic, rather than in hospital.  ""that's something that they didn't have access to before covid but a lesson i would be keen to continue on after covid,"" she says, adding, ""i think it's made a big difference for patient care, by reducing unnecessary admissions to hospital"".  when it comes to cases that do require hospital treatment though, dr hunter is keen to stress that ""we are open for business"".  that's the message in intensive care too where coach driver john johnston is struggling with the effects of covid-19.   john johnston was conscious but on a ventilator so unable to speak  john has underlying kidney issues and has developed a lung infection. he is conscious but on a ventilator which helps him to breathe but leaves him unable to talk.  instead he communicates, with great effort, by writing on a small plastic board.  i ask him if he can sum up his message to the staff here.  ""there are too many words to say to them,"" he manages to write before stopping to wipe away tears.  this pandemic has clearly brought immense and painful challenges for patients and staff alike.  hope, though, springs eternal.   irene norwood was told she should telephone her loved ones because she might not survive  irene norwood, a 51-year-old housewife from cumbernauld, is back in the intensive care unit â€” but only to say thank you. after a brush with death she is on the mend.  she tells us she only has fragments of memory about her time being treated in here for covid-19.  ""i remember lying in bed at night thinking the machines were talking to each other. i think i must have been hallucinating,"" she says.  irene also recalls a doctor telling her that she was being put on a ventilator and that she should telephone her loved ones because she might not survive.  ""i remember everything was happening really quickly and they said, 'we need to get her to call her family'.  ""i spoke to my husband and my sons. you can only say what's in your heart,"" she recalls.

health,"are people having fewer heart attacks? and should hospitals protect black, asian and minority ethnic healthcare workers by taking them off the front line? dr john wright of bradford royal infirmary considers these questions in his latest diary.  4 may 2020  one of the intriguing observations during the pandemic has been the marked reduction in patients coming to hospital with acute heart attacks or strokes.  our initial worry was that people were frightened to come in when they needed to - suffering their symptoms at home rather than risking getting infected in hospital. this may still turn out to be the case, but heart attacks and strokes are the sort of episodes in which you would expect patients to seek help. you would expect them to be picked up by health services.  perhaps the slowing down of our frantic lives from our enforced lockdown, and even the cleaner air we are breathing from the reductions in traffic, are helping to keep us in finer fettle? our slow living might be nurturing new healthier habits and lifestyles.  one clue has emerged from people using the fitbit health and fitness tracker in the us.  heart rate is a good indicator for heart health - the lower your resting heart rate the better - and fitbit has found that during lockdown average resting heart rates have fallen.  also, while step counts have also fallen, the number of active minutes has actually gone up - people have swapped desk-based routines for more mobile routines at home.  sleep duration has also increased with people going to bed earlier than normal and sleeping longer. it seems as though the lockdown has had the health-promoting effect of a good holiday.  front line diary   tom lawton  prof john wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the bradford institute for health research, and a veteran of cholera, hiv and ebola epidemics in sub-saharan africa. he is writing this diary for bbc news and recording from the hospital wards for bbc radio 4's the nhs front line  prof alistair hall, a cardiologist and clinical director for yorkshire and humber of the national institute for health research, says he hasn't seen evidence yet of people just staying at home after having heart attacks. on the other hand, he has seen people out exercising in unusually large numbers.  ""i have to drive into the hospital, but as i do i see the roads full of people walking and cycling families. i've never seen anything like it. it looks as if everyone has the time as a family to exercise, and they're taking that opportunity to get out of their homes,"" he says.  he also thinks that people may be more active throughout the day. rather than sitting at a desk for hours and hours they're taking more breaks, walking around, or going up and down stairs, even if they are taking fewer steps overall.  but there's another possible factor at play. he thinks people are remembering to take their medicine.  ""cholesterol is the single biggest preventable cause of heart attacks and strokes in the world,"" he says. ""and i think there's evidence suggests that during this time people are being much much better at taking medications that otherwise they might be forgetting or missing.""  and that extra bit of sleep? he's also confident it's doing people good.  ""good quality sleep is very advantageous in terms of health, and i guess people haven't needed to get up as early,"" he says. there's a benefit in terms of heart disease, but also for the immune system, ""which is really important at the time of an infectious pandemic"".  prof hall does add a note of caution, though: ""i'm sure there's some bad side to this, which might include eating too much chocolate or drinking too much alcohol.""  but if so, the effect doesn't appear to be registering just yet. it may become more visible later.  there is escalating national concern about the heightened risk to black, asian and minority ethnic patients from covid-19.  there are some possible explanations to do with relative poverty, with underlying health problems, with overcrowded housing, and with employment in front-line health and service roles. the suspicion is that there are also genetic factors at play. whatever the reasons, it could have big implications for the future, particularly in the national health service.  there is a real urgency in addressing this concern in a city like bradford, where almost a third of our population and nhs staff are non-white.   john wright  registrar rabeia javid says her eight-year-old son worried at the start of the epidemic, but now admires her choice of career  and the fact that 64% of the covid-positive nhs staff who have died nationwide are bame has caused ripples of anxiety to spread to the hospital.  measuring the risk of death from covid in hospital  people face a number of risks, from exposure and infection, to the risk of ending up in hospital, and then the ultimate risk of dying.  we have looked at the last of these - the risk of dying in hospital - among the first 1,276 patients at bradford royal infirmary who were tested for covid-19.  of the 464 patients who tested positive, mortality was 23%, which is lower than some of the national study results, and crucially we've found no evidence of differences by ethnicity. this is timely and reassuring evidence for our communities.  dr sam khan, consultant in acute medicine, has been ill with covid-19 since 20 march - more than six weeks - and at one point he needed hospital treatment. his main symptoms have been a dry hacking cough and tiredness. he hopes to be well enough to return to work on 15 may.  i asked him what he thought about suggestions that bame staff should be kept away from the front line.   sam khan  acute medicine consultant sam khan and his wife - neither looking worried in this photograph  he points out that that would be very difficult in bradford, and in the nhs generally, because of the large proportion of bame workers in the healthcare system - and that it would be odd to tell people who had trained to be a doctor or nurse that they couldn't see patients because they were black or asian, or from a minority ethnic group.  ""i don't know how you'd do it, you'd have to start thinking differently about recruitment policies,"" he says.  what does it mean for an acute physician like sam in the longer term, bearing in mind that he won't know whether the patients he sees are covid-positive or not.  ""do we start testing everybody as they come through the door, like we're doing for hiv now, where we test the majority of people aged between 18 and 65?"" he asks.  i ask him if he is worried.  ""we don't know how immune i'm going to be in the future,"" he replies. ""yes, it does. it does make me worry. it makes my wife worry more, but it makes me worried.""  follow @docjohnwright on twitter  you may also be interested in:  conspiracy theories have been spreading within parts of the bame community that hospital staff want them to die, reports dr john wright - meanwhile, figures suggest an increase in deaths in bradford outside hospital.  fake news makes patients think we want them to die"
health,"the uk has now overtaken italy to have the highest number of officially recorded coronavirus deaths in europe.  the figures - announced by both governments daily - show a total of 29,427 deaths in the uk and 29,315 in italy.  but can you make a fair comparison between the two countries?  there are challenges around doing this at the moment and here are some of the factors to take into account.  1. population sizes  for a start, the uk's population is roughly 66 million, and italy's is about 60 million.  so the uk would have to register at least 10% more deaths than italy for it to have a higher death rate per person.  given that italy is further past the peak of the outbreak, and is now recording significantly fewer deaths per day than the uk, that may well happen.     2. the two countries may not be counting the same way  the different ways different countries count deaths also need to be considered.  ""every country measures deaths in a different way,"" the uk government's chief medical adviser chris whitty said at one daily briefing, ""so comparing them to each other is a largely fruitless exercise"".  on the face of it, italy and the uk now do it in fairly similar ways - only including confirmed covid-19 cases in their cumulative daily counts.  but while it is safe to assume the figures for the numbers of deaths in hospitals are fairly accurate, can the same be said about deaths in care homes or at home?  there is no national figure in italy for deaths in care homes - the numbers are collated on a regional basis and slightly different measures are being used in different parts of the country.  but, says eleonora perobelli, a researcher at the observatory on long term care in milan, ""the vast majority of officially confirmed covid-19 related deaths are registered in hospitals"".  we do know that the uk figures as of 5 may include more than 4,600 people who died ""in a community setting'""- in other words outside hospital. we also know that there were relatively few tests carried out in care homes until recently.  but in italy, we simply don't know how many of the italian deaths may have occurred outside hospital.  so it is difficult in this case to be confident that we really are comparing like with like.     3. testing  given that the daily figures released by both governments are for people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus, how much testing is going on is clearly important.  to use an extreme example, if neither country had tested any people at all, nobody would have died after testing positive. on the other hand, if everybody in the country had been tested the deaths figure would have been much higher.  the uk is currently testing more people per day than italy, but overall italy, which has been in lockdown longer, has carried out more than 2.2 million tests as of 5 may while the uk has done over 1.3 million.  for daily figures that are based on people who have tested positive for the virus, that is a crucial distinction, which makes comparing the figures problematic.     4. what is the age and health of the population?  the most useful comparison to make between two countries looks at the total number of deaths from all causes adjusted for age.  why would you adjust for age?  we know that coronavirus affects older people more severely than younger people. older people are much more likely to have the underlying health conditions that make coronavirus so much more dangerous.  in the uk for example, in the week to 24 april, we know that coronavirus killed:  four per 100,000 people under the age of 75  75 per 100,000 of the 75-84 group  242 per 100,000 people over 85  italy has fewer young people and more old people percentage of population in three age groups  italy has a higher proportion of older people and a smaller proportion of children (who are much less likely to be severely affected) so, if all other factors were equal, you would expect more coronavirus deaths in italy than the uk.  the other thing you might want to adjust for would be the overall health of the population, which would be relevant for how many people you would expect to die in a given period.  this is usually expressed by giving the number of excess deaths. if you were looking for the number of excess deaths in april, for example, it would be the number of people who have died minus the average number of deaths in april over the previous five years.  it is important to compare with the same period in previous years because we expect more people to die in winter than in summer.  in italy, from 20 february when the first coronavirus death was reported until the end of march, there were 90,946 deaths from all causes, compared with the average of 65,592 for the previous five years - that's an excess of 25,354 deaths.  it would be best to compare that with the six-week period after the first coronavirus death in the uk. the excess deaths figures are published weekly by the ons.  you could take the six weeks starting with the week to 6 march, because that is when the first death occurred. if you do that then you find that 89,735 people died from all causes in the uk, compared with an average of 72,812 in the same period of the previous five years, which is an excess of 16,923.  but you could also start a week later, which is when the first death was registered and so appears in the ons figures. if you do that you get a figure of almost 30,000 excess deaths.  so it is probably too early to make this comparison - it currently only appears to be a measure of how fast the virus spread. given another month of extra data for italy we might be able to make a meaningful comparison.     5. what about population density and other factors?  other factors surrounding the disease - the epidemiology - also have to be taken into account.  it's not just about the size of your population.  you also have to take account of the way that population is distributed around the country, and of relevant characteristics such as underlying health conditions.  we know that the density of population is important for the spreading of coronavirus - it's much more difficult to keep your distance in a crowded area.  overall, the uk is considerably more densely populated, with about 275 people per sq km compared with about 205 in italy.  and the most crowded part of the uk is london, which is western europe's largest and most global city. it's hardly surprising that it has been one of the epicentres of this outbreak.  but if london (population roughly nine million) has been the worst hit region in the uk, then lombardy (population roughly 10 million and more widely dispersed) has been the worst hit region in italy.  figures from the italian statistics agency istat show just how bad things have been in parts of northern italy. deaths in lombardy during march 2020 were 186.5% above the five-year average for that time of year, and in the specific area around the city of bergamo they were 567.6% above the average.  that's higher than in london, and helps explain why the shocking scenes of overcrowding that were seen in some italian hospitals have not been replicated in london hospitals.  but it's also worth emphasising that the virus hit northern italy before it hit the uk, and lombardy had less time to prepare. in parts of southern italy, the number of deaths recorded this year is actually below the five year average.  this piece was originally published on 5 may. it has been updated to add another excess deaths figure.  what claims do you want bbc reality check to investigate?

health,"the government has come under pressure from mps and businesses to relax the 2m (6ft) rule for social distancing, to make it easier for people to return to work.  but scientists continue to question whether that would be safe, given how little is known about how far coronavirus can spread.  what does the science say?  the simple answer is that the closer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus.  the world health organization says that a distance of 1m is safe. some countries have adopted this guidance, while others, including the uk, have gone further:  1m distancing rule - china, denmark, france, hong kong, lithuania, singapore  1.4m - south korea  1.5m - australia, belgium, germany, greece, italy, netherlands, portugal  1.8m - us  2m - canada, spain, uk  media playback is unsupported on your device media caption the uk government is advising us to stay two metres apart - but what does that look like?  it's not just about distance  timing is also key. the longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk.  scientists advising the uk government say that spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m.  being exposed to someone coughing is riskier. being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance.  what's the latest research?  in a study published in the medical journal the lancet, scientists evaluated recent research into how the coronavirus can spread.  they conclude that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection.  the risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m, but only 3% beyond that distance.  and the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m, the risk is further reduced by half.  where does the distancing rule come from?  it can be traced back to research in the 1930s.  scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground.  most of those droplets, they reckoned, would land within 1-2m.  that is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range, or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto, and then touching your face.     can the virus travel further in other ways?  many scientists regard closeness and surface contacts as the main routes of transmission.  but some researchers are concerned that the coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols.  if that is the case, then the flow of wind from someone's breath could carry the virus over longer distances.  professor lydia bourouiba from the massachusetts institute of technology (mit) used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m.  and a study carried out at hospitals in china, which found traces of coronavirus in covid-19 wards and intensive care units, estimated that 4m was a better safe distance.  but for the us centers for disease control, the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is ""currently uncertain"".  and what's still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious.  what else makes a difference?  there is wide agreement that the infection is more easily passed on indoors than outside in the fresh air.  japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of covid-19, following up the contacts of the people infected.  they estimated that the odds of the infection being passed on were nearly 19 times greater indoors than when outside.  in many countries, including england and scotland, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible"".     why don't we have definite answers?  it is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it.  but there is a long way to go and confirming exactly the right distance is one of the unanswered questions.  it will take careful studies of how the virus can be carried, and how viable it remains, which will all take time."
health,"st george's hospital  dr nigel kennea trained as a doctor for newborn babies and is now focused on helping the bereaved  when dr nigel kennea talks of the ""unexpectedness and awfulness"" of deaths in his hospital in the past six weeks, he tempers it with a positive focus on helping bereaved families left behind.  as a medical examiner at st george's hospital, in south london, his job is to advise clinical teams on completing death certificates, then support relatives through their grief.  but like so much during this pandemic, none of that is straightforward.  ""the most harrowing thing is knowing that many said goodbye to their loved ones in an ambulance,"" he says.  despite staff ""going above and beyond"" to support patients in desperate times, using mobile phones and ipads to connect seriously ill patients and their families, contact is just not always possible.  even after a patient's death, social distancing has meant grieving relatives are left in limbo.  ""normally, registering a death is done face-to-face with relatives,"" dr kennea says.  ""they come in, talk through the admin and how to plan for after death.  ""now, it's all done on the phone.""  'share the burden'  dr kennea's job is to take an overview of all deaths at the hospital. it's a relatively new role in the uk, introduced last year, which is independent of trusts.  previously he was a specialist in the care of newborn babies.  now, dr kennea discusses each death at the hospital with the doctors and nurses involved in that patient's care, making sure death certificates are completed correctly and consistently.     with covid-19 deaths so closely scrutinised, there is added pressure and ""some are complicated"", he says.  there is still so much doctors are learning about the virus and its effects on people's bodies - such as heart failure, thrombosis, kidney problems and pneumonia.  but, dr kennea says: ""if a test for coronavirus has been carried out and is positive, that goes on the death certificate as it is likely to have contributed to the death.""  and the hospital aims to report these deaths to national bodies on the day they happen.  although those that seem unnatural or have no certain cause must be referred to a coroner.  but the role he is most proud of is supporting bereaved families - talking to them about what is on the certificate, the care the patient received and next steps for the funeral.  ""we share the burden together,"" he says.  'human touch'  these conversations with families are when life stories are told and memories shared. there is often laughter too.  and there is now more demand than ever for hospitals to have good communication skills and show sensitivity towards families.  ""we are better at this than we were six weeks ago,"" dr kennea says.   st george's hospital  dr kennea and the medical examiner team contact families after a death  ""so many people are so grateful for our support.  ""and they often say they appreciated the human touch,"" he says.  st george's hospital had its first covid-19 death on 12 march.  since then, 250 people have died with the illness at the hospital, while more than 600 have recovered and been discharged.  in the worst week, 60 patients died with covid-19.  by turning normal wards into intensive care units and training up staff to work there, this large hospital has coped through all the turmoil.  and it has even been able to take covid-19 patients needing dialysis from other london hospitals.  but there has been immense pressure on front-line staff, kitted out in personal protective equipment day in, day out.  when dr kennea goes into covid-19 areas, he too wears full ppe - but it has its limits when communicating with patients.  ""it's hard to share a smile behind a mask and goggles,"" he says.  'violent tragedy'  now, 60 patients with covid-19 are being ventilated in the hospital's intensive care unit.  at the peak, it was 120.  there is a sense the situation is improving and that is ""really gratifying"", dr kennea says.  yet there is so much from the past few months he will never forget.  he has marvelled at human powers of recovery - sometimes in the most unexpected places, such as among the very elderly.  but at the same time, he has seen younger people whose lives have been cruelly taken.  ""it is just a violent tragedy,"" he says.  ""it is such an exceptional time for lives being snatched away."""
politics,ukip could sue veritas defectors the uk independence party could take legal action to unseat two london assembly members who defected to robert kilroy silk s veritas party.  damian hockney  now veritas deputy leader  and peter hulme-cross were elected in 2004 on the list system. the party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as ukip representatives  not as individuals. mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats. ukip chairman petrina holdsworth urged the men to step down from the gla in a letter.  she said:  the party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you.  we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done  to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election.  mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems.  the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list  their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party.  he said mr hulme-cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was ukip who were not being true to the electorate. he accused the party of signing up to a deal with the tories in europe  rather than sticking to an independent stance. but the claim was denied by ukip spokesman  who said:  mr hockney s accusations are like his sense of political morals - empty.  veritas was formed by mr kilroy-silk earlier this month after he quit ukip following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.
politics,talks aim to avert pension strike talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.  five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour s spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however  all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election  said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days  britain s biggest union unison will start balloting 800 000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.  the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow  said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the  less painful  option  our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.  for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service  choice on this and choice on that - isn t it ironic that they re saying to public sector workers there is no choice   he said.  if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop.  in the 20th century  it s completely unacceptable.   unison s 800 000 workers  the transport and general workers  union s 70 000 and amicus  20 000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.
sport,federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic.  top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. but ljubicic  who beat tim henman in the last eight  dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool  though  turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. the match was a re-run of last week s final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam  where federer triumphed  but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets.  i really wanted to get off to a good start this time  and i did  and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm   federer said.   that took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back  and that was a good effort on his side.  ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set.  i didn t start badly  but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. and with roger  if you relax for a second it just goes very quick   he said.  after those first three games it was no match at all. i don t know  it was really weird. i was playing really well the whole year  and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.  but despite his defeat  the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance.  i had a chance in the third  and for me it s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match.  it s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that i m up there and belong with top-class players.
sport,calder fears for scottish rugby former scotland international finlay calder fears civil war at the sru could seriously hamper his country s rbs six nations campaign.  four members of the executive board  including the chairman  david mackay  have resigned after a simmering row. and calder said:  this is terrible news for every level of scottish rugby.  david is a successful businessman and i thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level  it was him.  mackay s executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee  which contains members elected by scotland s club sides.  he has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can t be run by amateurs   said calder.   in fact  i don t understand why we are still having this argument 10 years after professionalism arrived.  but i don t believe the rest of the sru will take this lying down.  i think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and  ultimately  it is them who pull the strings.  so i wouldn t be surprised if they reviewed their position. but  in the wider picture  what message does this send out   he thought the work of scotland s coaches  who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side  would be made much more difficult.  matt williams and willie anderson must be wondering   what have we walked into here    said calder.  and we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the six nations championship.  i am very  very disappointed  more than you can imagine. why do so many scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough
politics,blair rejects iraq advice calls tony blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation.  the prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the attorney general. earlier  conservative mp michael mates joined calls for a probe into claims lord goldsmith s statement to parliament was drawn up at number 10. mr blair said the statement was a  fair summary  of lord goldsmith s opinion.   that s what he (lord goldsmith) said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue  saying it had been dealt with  literally scores of times and the position has not changed . lord goldsmith has denied being  leaned on  and says the words written were his.  the government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. mr mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence  told the bbc on friday:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said.  mr mates added:  we discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers  advice to the government has been published.  and this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.  this is argument was rejected by mr blair  who said:  firstly  we haven t broken the precedent  and secondly peter goldsmith has made his statement and i have got absolutely nothing to add to it.  in a book published this week  philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers  says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.  but a short statement about lord goldsmith s position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action. mr sands  book suggests it was actually written by home office minister lord falconer and downing street adviser baroness morgan. former minister clare short  who resigned from the government over the iraq war  said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she told the bbc the full advice should have been attached  according to the ministerial code.   my view is we need the house of lords to set up a special committee  summon the attorney  get all the papers out  look at exactly what happened   she said. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. on thursday  lord goldsmith said his statement had not been  written by or at number 10 .  in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003  i explained my genuinely held independent view  that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions   he said.
health,"victor de jesus  john wright spreading the message that people should stay at home  march 29 2020  the covid-19 outbreak has already brought a range of challenges for front line medical staff - shortages of equipment, doctors and nurses falling ill, and even thieves trying to break in and steal valuable supplies. in the first of a series of diaries, dr john wright reports on preparations at bradford royal infirmary.  following the uk-wide lockdown, the hospital followed suit in a bid to limit transmission of the coronavirus.  eighteen entrances across the 26-acre site were sealed off and everyone is now funnelled through one main door. staff must show their passes and patients are no longer allowed to bring visitors with them, even when they're coming in for cancer treatments.  but not long before millions of people across the uk stepped out of their houses and applauded nhs workers, one man carefully dressed in doctor's scrubs. he even completed his disguise with a stethoscope. he then attempted to bluff his way past a security guard, who demanded to see his pass, and when he was caught he made a run for it.   john wright  hospital scrubs are being used as disguise - so now have to be locked away  there had already been thefts of surgical gowns, masks, protective equipment and sanitisers. it's possible this man was after supplies like these, or possibly drugs. the head of the bradford hospital trust, mel pickup, has heard that there are now shortages on the streets because of the epidemic.

""where do you go if you want drugs and you can't get those on the street any more?""  hospital scrubs are now having to be stored under lock and key.  front line diary   john wright  prof john wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the bradford institute for health research. he has looked after patients in epidemics all over the world, including cholera, hiv and ebola outbreaks in sub-saharan africa. over the next few weeks he will be reporting for the bbc on how his hospital, the bradford royal infirmary, copes with covid-19.  we know from what's been happening in italy how covid-19 is likely to affect us in bradford. multi-generational households are common in italy and also here - particularly among pakistanis, who make up just under a third of the population and are genetically predisposed to heart disease and diabetes, the very underlying health conditions that can make covid-19 particularly deadly. there are poor areas in bradford, and some white people have high levels of lung disease from smoking.  we know there is a tsunami coming.   john wright  at present there are 16 intensive care beds in the hospital and that's usually enough, but it's been projected that we could be treating 500 people at the peak of the epidemic, so we need to ramp up very quickly. a disused ward has been fitted with ventilators and other wards are being reconfigured.  dr debbie horner, in charge of covid-19 intensive care planning, says accepting the scale of what's happening has been like going through the stages of bereavement. ""initially you've got a kind of shock and then comes denial and acceptance,"" she told me. ""as an intensive care community, most of us are now in the kind of acceptance phase.""  find out more  john wright is recording from the hospital wards for bbc radio 4's nhs on the front line  you can hear the next episode at 11:00 on tuesday 31 march, catch up with the first episode online, or download the podcast  we have also been taking steps to obtain more personal protective equipment.  our stocks of surgical masks are good, but supplies of more effective ppe masks and eye-protection visors were running low. so a consultant, dr tom lawton, went to screwfix to buy industrial masks - and then found a way of attaching medical filters to them, using a 3d printer he keeps in his garage. another went to a builders' merchants and bought 2,000 pairs of goggles.   john wright  consultant tom lawton in one of his modified industrial masks  consultant anaesthetist dr michael mccooe, meanwhile, started looking into ways of sterilising masks, so they could be re-used, and called whittaker's gin distillery in the yorkshire dales. mr whittaker himself answered the phone, and said that his 96% proof gin could be diluted for the purpose.  ""he was very happy to donate to us,"" dr mccooe told me. ""he'd been looking into whether they could supply more alcohol to the health service and whether they could make hand sanitiser. it's a great step forward and now we just need somewhere safe to store it all!""  but in the last week or so, both debbie horner and michael mccooe have gone into isolation.   john wright  one of tom lawton's masks after sterilisation in alcohol from the gin distillery  debbie called me on the afternoon of friday 20 march, just before we were going to run our covid-19 case rehearsals, to say that she had some mild symptoms and was going to go home, just to be on the safe side. we haven't yet started testing staff for the virus, but given how important she was, we felt that we needed to make an exception - and so we arranged for a surreptitious visit to accident and emergency on saturday morning to swab for covid-19 and other more likely seasonal viruses.  then, on monday, our microbiologist rang to drop the bombshell: the swab had come back positive.  a day later the clinical director of urgent care, dr sam khan, started to feel unwell. and then dr michael mccooe was forced to self-isolate because his partner, another anaesthetist at the hospital, was ill. it seems likely that we were infecting one another as we planned our response to coronavirus, until we got our social distancing house in order.  if we lose many more of our senior clinical leaders at this early stage of the campaign it would be a disaster.  we have a rapidly increasing number of cases, but it still feels like the calm before the storm. and the eye of the storm will be in our intensive care unit."
health,"at 20:00 bst on thursday, households across the uk stood on their doorsteps and balconies and applauded the efforts of the nhs and care workers in treating those affected by covid-19.     the initiative was devised by annemarie plas, from brixton, south-west london, who was inspired by same event happening in her home country of the netherlands, and in many other countries.  annemarie posted details of the event on her social media channels, and enthusiasm for taking part quickly spread across the uk.  ""i hope that it creates a positive boost for those on the frontline,"" she said.  ""but also [when] you hear your neighbours applauding you know that we are together in this, because we are currently all in our houses.""  there was applause in manchester, below.           people cheered in blackpool (above) and london (below).     there was support from northampton.            pa media  residents in glasgow (above) and hove (below) showed their support.     the nhs staff at royal liverpool university hospital heard the public's appreciation and also joined in the applause.   pa media  buildings around the uk were also lit in blue - the colour of the nhs logo - to pay tribute to the work of nhs staff, including wembley park underground station, below.   pa media  the kelpies in falkirk, a metal sculpture of horse heads, was lit up in blue.   pa media  belfast city hall turned blue.   pa media  london's piccadilly circus saluted nhs heroes on its iconic massive led screen.     lincoln cathedral lit up in blue.   pa media  blackpool tower featured a blue heart.   pa media  the arch at wembley stadium in london was an arc of blue - and the stadium has promised to repeat the tribute every evening during the crisis.   pa media  all photographs subject to copyright."
sport,iranian misses israel match iranian striker vahid hashemian will not travel to israel for bayern munich s champions league match against maccabi tel aviv on wednesday.  the german club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury. iran refuses to recognise israel s right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country. a bayern spokesman said on monday that the decision not to take hashemian to israel had been motivated only by his physical condition.  he s got back pain and he couldn t train   the spokesman said.  it would have made no sense for him to go.  iran gave judo world champion arash miresmaeili a $125 000 reward when he refused to fight an israeli at the athens olympics. the international judo federation considered taking action against miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part.
sport,britain boosted by holmes double athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals.  kelly holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the olympic games. holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over team gb after their biggest medal hope  paula radcliffe  dropped out of the marathon and then the 10 000m. britain s men s 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. holmes had started the year in disappointing style  falling over in the final of 1500m at the world indoor championships where she was favourite. her olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival maria mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. just five days later  the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. it was the first time in 84 years a briton has achieved the olympic middle-distance double. while holmes left athens as the star of team gb  it was radcliffe who carried expectations before the august games.  the 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the athens event as favourite but an exhausted radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. her decision to enter the 10 000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining.  but radcliffe helped put her olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in november s new york marathon. the 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the british men s olympic squad after a poor start to the games.  it seemed as though athens would be the first games where the men would fail to win a medal with michael east the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. but darren campell  jason gardener  marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis made amends in the sprint relay. the quartet held off favourites the usa to win britain s first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. gardener added the olympic relay crown to his world indoor title over 60m and  just like holmes  finally lived up to his promise in 2004. kelly sotherton completed team gb s athletics medal haul in athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. the 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003.  but it was a different story for britain s defending champion denise lewis  who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. lewis  who was troubled by injury  has ruled out retiring while sotherton is tipped to build on her success. the athens olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for steve backley  who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. the battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one olympic bronze.  and backley s departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete dean macey  who came fourth in athens.  the continued improvement of sprinter abi oyepitan and long jumper chris tomlinson also boosted team gb. sadly  the 2004 olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. on the eve of the games  greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.  kenteris  the 200m champion in 2000  and thanou have since been charged by the greek authorities and await trial. at the games  adrian annus (hammer)  robert fazelas (discus) and irina korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. hungarian compatriots annus and fazelas both refused to give urine samples while russian korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol.  the fallout from the thg scandal  which rocked the sport in 2003  continued to impact in olympic year. britain s 4x100m team took gold without the services of dwain chambers  who was handed a two-year ban in february after testing positive for steroid thg.  american kelli white was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. and world 400m champion jerome young landed a life ban from us chiefs after a second doping offence. russian pole vaulter yelena isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the world indoor and olympic titles. her rivalry with compatriot svetlana feofanova livened up the field events. morocco s hicham el guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic olympic double in the 1500m and 5 000m.  and though there was no paula radcliffe in the london marathon  there was plenty of drama as kenyans evans rutto and margaret okayo took the titles. rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.
sport,campbell to be lions consultant former government communications chief alastair campbell will act as a media consultant to sir clive woodward s 2005 lions on their tour to new zealand.  campbell  who left downing street earlier this year  will advise on media strategy before and during the tour.  i hope i can contribute to the planning and preparation  and to ensuring the media and public get the most out of the tour itself   he said.  i am also looking forward to going out for the later stages of the tour.  woodward s decision to call in prime minister tony blair s former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last lions tour of australia in 2001  when new zealander graham henry was the head coach. the furore surrounding the newspaper diaries of matt dawson and austin healey was compounded by other disillusioned players venting their frustration through the media.  the lions is a massive media event   said woodward  who will be the head coach.  there will be a huge level of interest from the travelling media  the fans that will go out in their thousands and the new zealand public.  we need to have the strategy and processes in place to deal with the pressures that will bring.  [alastair] will act as an advisor both in the build up to and on the tour itself. his role is to work closely with not only myself but (tour manager) bill beaumont  (media manager) louisa cheetham and (team manager) louise ramsay.  campbell is due to resume working for the government in the new year in the build-up to an anticipated may general election. the lions leave for new zealand on 24 may  with the first test match against the all blacks in christchurch on 25 june.
sport,ferdinand casts doubt over glazer rio ferdinand has said he is unsure of malcolm glazer s motives after the american billionaire launched a new offer to buy manchester united.  the club have confirmed that the glazer family partnership have submitted proposals of a third bid.  a lot of people want the club s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart   said ferdinand.  no one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.  the central defender added on bbc radio five live:  we will have to wait and see what glazer comes with.  i would like to see the situation resolved either way.  i think people are getting bored with him coming in and out of the news with new proposals.  the other stuff off the pitch takes the shine off what is going on the pitch.   glazer  currently owns a 28.1% stake in the club  and united s statement to the stock exchange said:  the board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject.  the board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various pre-conditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer.  a further announcement will be made in due course.  glazer s previous bids for the club  which united supporters opposed  were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur. but it is believed that glazer has substantially reduced the borrowing required for his latest move. he will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus  who own 28.9% of the club to succeed. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake  while fans remain opposed to his involvement.
sport,wales win in rome wales secured their first away win in the rbs six nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in rome.  tries from jonathan thomas  tom shanklin and martyn williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. luciano orquera did reply with one for italy but second-half efforts from brent cockbain  shane williams and robert sidoli sealed victory. fly-half stephen jones added four conversions as wales maintained their superb start to this year s tournament. starting full of confidence after their victory over england  the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. diminutive wing shane williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing andrea masi and aaron persico into the italian half. his pass to tom shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short  the ball was switched left and michael owen s long cut-out pass gave the lurking thomas an easy run-in.  stephen jones  who retained the kicking duties despite gavin henson s heroics against england  slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass  and italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.  henson  sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for england  beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. but his attempted chip ahead was charged down by orquera  who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. with the welsh line-out stuttering and italy twice turning the visitors  scrum  the home side s forward power brought them back into it. but a clever high kick from henson almost brought a try for hal luscombe when roland de marigny and ludovico nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.  wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute  henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where shanklin jumped higher than nitoglia to dot down his 15th test try. jones was unable to convert and de marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for italy. henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal  but wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space.  henson sent luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to martyn williams  the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post  jones adding the conversion. italy  who lost flanker mauro bergamasco with a head knock before half-time  built up a head of steam on the resumption. de marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. but wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from shane williams  who beat several players with ease  and finished with a powerful angled run from lock cockbain. before italy could recover from that blow  a strong surge from gareth thomas and great off-loads from martyn williams and replacement kevin morgan saw shane williams scamper over.  with jones converting both for a 33-8 lead  wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. the icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work  shane williams and ceri sweeney combining to send sidoli over in the left corner. the only downside for wales was a hamstring injury suffered by luscombe. but after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years  they will travel to paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.  r de marigny; mirco bergamasco  w pozzebon  a masi  l nitoglia; l orquera  a troncon; a lo cicero  f ongaro  m castrogiovanni  s dellape  m bortolami (capt)  a persico  mauro bergamasco  s parisse.  g intoppa  s perugini  ca del fava  d dal maso  p griffen  m barbini  kp robertson.  g thomas (capt); h luscombe  t shanklin  g henson  s williams; s jones  d peel; g jenkins  m davies  a jones; b cockbain  r sidoli; j thomas  m williams  m owen.  r mcbryde  j yapp  i gough  r sowden-taylor  g cooper  c sweeney  k morgan.  andrew cole (australia).
sport,gallas sees two-horse race chelsea s william gallas believes they will battle it out with arsenal for the premiership in the coming months.   it ll be a two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything   he told bbc sport.  you need to be good and you need a lot of luck. you need a bit of both but it will be as hard for the arsenal players as it is for the chelsea boys.   we know that we have got the power in our hands just now   added gallas.   but you never know what is going to happen in football - two seasons ago manchester united picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title.  obviously  nobody at chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football.  we will be challenging to come first as much as every arsenal player will be challenging to come first.  gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager jose mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer.  and the french international defender believes mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt.  it s only normal when you have got a team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at chelsea is a fantastic manager like mourinho   he said.  he is the icing on the cake at the club. he has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything.  another incredible quality that mourinho has is that every player  even though the fans may consider them to be a stars  within the dressing-room they are absolutely equal.  mourinho reminds everyone but he doesn t have to because he has created a wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day.  it is a changed dressing-room from the atmosphere there was last year.
sport,o sullivan quick to hail italians ireland coach eddie o sullivan heaped praise on italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in rome.   it was a hell of a tough game   said o sullivan.  we struggled in the first half because we hadn t the football.  italy played really well. they handled the ball well in terms of kicking it  if that s not an oxymoron.  we said before the game that it might take until 10 minutes from the end for this game to be won  and that s how it turned out.  ireland struggled to cope with italy s fierce start and were indebted to skipper brian o driscoll  who set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer.  we had our first attack in the italian half after 22 minutes   said o sullivan.  we had a good return  with three first-half possessions in their half and we scored twice.  the second half was about spending more time in their half.  scrum-half peter stringer was also glad that ireland escaped wtih a victory.  all credit to them   he told bbc sport.  we knew it would be tough coming to rome. they always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit.  they had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their 22.
politics,brown to outline presidency goals next year will be  make or break  for development in poorer countries gordon brown will say as he sets out uk goals for its eu and g8 presidencies.  the chancellor is due to outline a series of key targets the government will be judged on in 2005. they will include doubling aid from donor countries and eliminating debt owed by the poorest nations. mr brown also wants other g8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income.  he also wants the richer countries to do more to help the development of vaccines for aids and malaria. the chancellor is travelling to america next week as part of his persuasion drive over the issue. he told bbc radio 4 s today programme:  we need more resources allied to progress on trade and progress on debt relief if we are going to make an impact on the problems of ill health  of illiteracy  of poverty  particularly in africa but right through the developing countries.   his proposals were effectively a new  marshall plan  for the world  including an international finance facility  which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year. agreement in the doha development talks could also give developing nations the trading ability they needed  he argued. the european union s common agricultural policy had caused aggravated trade problems  he said  but there was now an agreement to end export subsidies.  mr brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years. but with 30 000 children were dying unnecessarily every day more was needed  including 100% debt relief multilaterally.  that is why next year is a test   he said.  if after five years of making promises the world is not prepared to honour them  then people will be justified in saying they promised but they did not produce results.  the catholic aid agency cafod will host mr brown s speech on wednesday.  cafod wants britain to use its influence to pressure countries like the us to make firm commitments to tackle global poverty. mr brown said america too needed to take more action but defended president george bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption. oxfam s paying the price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels. the charity s director  barbara stocking  said:  2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough  but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure.  the report said the g8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.  but 34 years later none of the organisations members had reached this target and many had not yet set a timetable. mr blair  who has described africa as a  scar  on the world s conscience  has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. but band aid founder bob geldof in july said he was sick of hearing  guff  about scars on the world. it was pathetic that britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor  he added. conservative shadow international development secretary alan duncan accused mr brown of missing his target on providing anti-retroviral drug treatment to three million africans by 2005. instead  only 500 000 people would benefit  he said.  there s no point in him demanding praise and adulation for setting a whole new raft of targets when he has so woefully failed to meet the ones he already has   added mr duncan.
politics,ministers deny care sums  wrong  ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under-estimated.  a report by the fraser of allander institute says the decision to push ahead with the flagship policy was based on flawed research. deputy health minister rhona brankin has pledged to study the research. snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said the public needed reassurance that the care programme was secure.  the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the  care development group  of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings  according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university s fraser of allander institute.  dubious  assumptions about improving health expectancy could drive the cost of the policy up by another Â£130m by 2022  the report warned.  it was carried out by husband and wife economist team jim and margaret cuthbert. but ms brankin told bbc radio scotland:  we don t think we got our sums wrong.  obviously we will examine the findings of this new report  along with figures from our own research that we have already commissioned.  we will look in great detail at any contribution to this  because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future.  and we are absolutely committed to doing that.   but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy. ms sturgeon said that while she had no reason to doubt the executive s support for the policy  there were questions which needed to be answered and  if necessary  sums redone. she said:  serious concerns have been raised and there are questions which need to be answered by the scottish executive.  we need to know that the money is there  not just for this year or next year  but into the future so that older people  and those who are looking forward to older age  can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met.
politics,debate needed  on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet  the elections watchdog has said.  fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report  the electoral commission says it is worth debating a Â£10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.  there were almost Â£68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001  2002 and 2003  with nearly Â£12m of them from individual gifts worth more than Â£1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.  while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap  we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible   says its report. if there was to be a cap  it should be Â£10 000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned Â£56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.  even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under Â£200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to Â£3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons  european parliament  scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning  seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets  says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.  the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates  while cutting national spending limits from Â£20m to Â£15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said:  there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced.  our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible.  the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.  he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.
politics,howard and blair tax pledge clash tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labour s manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax.  the premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its post-election budget. mr blair derided tory claims they could cut Â£35bn in  wasteful spending  saying the party had got its sums wrong. the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre-election period. mr howard told mps that  every independent expert  from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the  government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes . mr blair replied:  i think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right.  the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth Â£4bn  although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced.  they also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats have said the party s sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. but mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. the liberal democrats have also launched their pre-election platform  with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the  authentic opposition   particularly on the iraq war  council tax and university tuition fees. labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a  fraudulent prospectus .
politics,tv debate urged for party chiefs broadcasters should fix a date for a pre-election televised debate between the three main political leaders  according to the hansard society.  it would then be up to tony blair  michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part  the non-partisan charity said. chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter  of public interest .  the broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead   he said.  lord holme s proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch us president george w bush slug it out verbally with his democratic challenger john kerry. he said it was a  democratically dubious proposition  that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here.  if mr blair did not want to take part  the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why  lord holme said.  what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate  no-one has heard directly from the prime minister   he said.  it has been left to nudges and winks  hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that mr blair doesn t want one  but we haven t heard from the prime minister himself.   lord holme  who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections  said broadcasters were  more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements . opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes  he said.  lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations  broadcasters  should make the decision to go ahead  as soon as the election is called. an independent third-party body such as the hansard society or electoral commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public  he said.  it would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse   said lord holme.   if the prime minister s reported position is true and he does want to take part  he would then be obliged to say why publicly.  the broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well-understood reasons  or going ahead with an empty chair.  either way would be preferable to the present hidden veto.  the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001. tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign. last month he said:  we answer this every election campaign and  for the reasons i have given before  the answer is no   he said at his monthly news conference.
politics,uk  needs true immigration data  a former home office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor uk immigration.  barbara roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government. she said this would counter  so-called independent  groups like migration watch  which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. migration watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. sir andrew green  chairman of the organisation  says there is no need for an independent body because office of national statistics data are accurate. he says he opposes large-scale immigration  both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture .  he said:  for example  over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration.  we are already more overcrowded than india and we are four times more overcrowded than france.  ms roche  labour mp for hornsey and wood green  believes legal migration is something we should welcome. she said her proposals mean  we wouldn t have so-called independent experts  like migration watch  who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view.  she went on:  what i would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures  published them  and was independent of government.  i think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.
politics,election  could be terror target  terrorists might try to target the uk in the run-up to the election  london s most senior police officer has said.  sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain s general election last year. other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk s presidency of the european union and g8  he said. he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack. no 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real.  the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial anti-terror proposals  warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting. sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be  unwise  to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack. but he said:  terrorists have long memories. they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate.   this year we are responsible for the eu presidency  presidency of the g8  a royal wedding and a general election.  there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with.  sir ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians  not the police  who would enforce any new powers.  home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madrid-style pre-election bombing could happen in the uk too. asked about sir ian s comments  the prime minister s official spokesman said:  we believe the threat is real.  the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. he said no 10 did not disclose any security advice they received. earlier  writing in the daily telegraph  the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were  difficult issues for any government . the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition  with the government s majority more than halved as 32 labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition. but mr blair insisted:  there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack.   tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of  using national security for political point scoring . liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labour s  authoritarian  response to crises. the prevention of terrorism bill proposes  control orders   which as well as house arrest could impose curfews  tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial  which the law lords have ruled against. but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders. the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords.
sport,wenger rules out new keeper arsenal boss arsene wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the january transfer window.  wenger has brought in manuel almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form jens lehmann - but the spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes. there have been suggestions that wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the new year. but he told the evening standard:  i don t feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in january.  the gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old almunia has made to his career at highbury. and he would not be drawn on whether lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with chelsea on sunday.  almunia was at fault for rosenborg s goal in arsenal s 5-1 champions league win on tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week s win over birmingham. but wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media.  the debate has gone on too long. everyone has an opinion and i do not have to add to it   wenger added. arsenal have been linked with middlesbrough keeper mark schwarzer  fulham s edwin van der sar and parma s sebastien frey. and wenger has no immediate plans to recall former england under-21 international stuart taylor from his loan spell at leicester.
sport,slovakia reach hopman cup final slovakia will play argentina in the final of the hopman cup after beating group b rivals the netherlands 3-0.  daniela hantuchova defeated michaella krajicek 6-4 6-2 to give the slovaks the perfect start before dutchman peter wessels retired against dominik hrbaty. wessels was unable to compete in the mixed doubles but slovakia had already booked their place in the final for the second year running. argentina claimed top spot in group a with three wins from three matches. in the other group b match  the united states defeated australia 2-1.  meghann shaughnessy lost the opening match against alicia molik but james blake levelled the tie with a 6-3 6-4 win over paul baccanello  who came in as a replacement for the injured mark philippoussis. blake and shaughnessy then beat molik and baccanello in a tense mixed doubles contest to take the win. hantuchova  who did not win a hopman cup singles match in 2004  has been in good form during this year s event and has won two of her three matches.  i feel like it s really deserved this time as i ve helped dominik to get through   she said.  i think if i keep going the way i have been in the past few matches then i will be okay.  i was really pleased with my last two singles  even the first one  which was a really high standard.  you can t ask for a better preparation than to play a few matches here for the australian open.
sport,collins calls for chambers return world 100m champion kim collins says suspended sprinter dwain chambers should be allowed to compete in the olympics again.  chambers was banned for two years after testing positive for the anabolic steroid thg and his suspension runs out in november this year. but collins says the british olympic association should reverse the decision to ban him from the olympics for life.  it was too harsh   collins told radio five live.  they should reconsider.  chambers has been in america learning american football but has not ruled out a return to the track. collins added:  he is a great guy and i have never had any problems with him. we are friends.  i would like to see dwain come back and compete again. he is a good person.  even though he made a mistake he understands what he did and should be given a chance once more.
sport,tevez - an argentine in brazil some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil.  he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige - which he failed to live up to. he left an impression  but not for reasons he would have wanted. the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play. even today   gandula  is the term used in brazil for ballboy. brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then  and many will delight now if history is repeated. another boca juniors player is coming to brazil.  the new maradona  - carlos tevez - is joining corinthians for nearly $20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. corinthians - or the london-based company who have just entered into partnership with them - appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez. it is particularly strange as - until last week - tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil  where the argentine championship is not shown.  presumably there is some financial logic behind the move. what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north  rather than across the atlantic. argentina s brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal. but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez. boca re-signed martin palermo  forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role. and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report - atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be  disorganized.  hounded by the press  tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires. so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of  tranquillity.  anyone acquainted with the city of s&#227;o paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration. brazil s biggest city is a sprawling  ugly  restless metropolis. once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants.  but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers. the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians. it is the most passionately supported club in brazil. pel&#233; scored reams of goals against them  reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own. that passion can also be turned against the team - especially nowadays  when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil s big cities. corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players. tevez  then  can kiss tranquillity goodbye. he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores  south america s champions league. corinthians have not qualified. indeed  he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match. next year s brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april. until then he will have to make do with the foolish s&#227;o paulo state championship  an appalling waste of his talent. there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina. like so many of the top south american players  tevez has the gift of being able to surprise - to feint right and go left  to pass when he was expected to dribble  to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all.
sport,curbishley delight for johansson charlton manager alan curbishley paid tribute to two-goal striker jonatan johansson after beating norwich.  curbishley said after the 4-0 win:  there was talk about norwich being interested in the summer but i have a lot of faith in jonatan.  when there was talk of other clubs i just told him he was going nowhere.  he s part of our squad and he got us a couple of important goals early on. i m sure he s happy here  but i was delighted with all the players.  curbishley was subjected to criticism from charlton fans recently  and he said:  the thing about this club is that we have got where we are by all pulling in the same direction.  that s happened for however long i ve been here and we don t want people taking sides.
sport,kenyon denies robben barca return chelsea chief executive peter kenyon has played down reports that arjen robben will return for the champions league match against barcelona.   he s been responding well to treatment and started running on friday  but we ll have to wait and see   he told bbc five live s sportsweek.  we re looking to getting him back as soon as possible  but he ll be back when it s right for him and for us.  there s no plans at the moment around the barcelona game.  his comments contradict those of chiropractor jean pierre meersseman who treated the dutchman after he fractured his foot at the start of february. robben had been expected to be out for six weeks  but meersseman hinted that the winger could be fit for the vital stamford bridge game on 8 march.  i hope he can be back and i will try to help him make that happen   meersseman told the mail on sunday.  i put everything right with arjen s foot the last time i saw him 12 days ago. it was an obvious correction and easy to perform.  i know he was pleased with what i did and now that he is running again. i am due to see him one more time again in the next few days.  meersseman is the medical co-ordinator at italian side ac milan.
politics,new  yob  targets to be unveiled fifty new areas getting special help to fight anti-social behaviour in england and wales will be named on thursday.  ten areas have already had access to special prosecutors and local experts and the government is now expanding the crackdown to more towns and cities. details of how many anti-social behaviour orders (asbos) were used in the last year are also being published. labour sees nuisance behaviour as a key election issue but critics claim the record is at best patchy. a year ago  ministers launched their anti-social behaviour plan and thursday s figures offer a progress check. they will say that in the past year more than 2 600 anti-social behaviour orders were issued by the courts - more than double the total used in the previous four years.  police have also closed 150 crack houses and issued more than 400 dispersal orders  breaking up groups of youths in public places. the 50 new pilot areas to get special attention will also receive extra government funding. exeter and cardiff are among cities who have voiced interest in being involved.  prime minister tony blair is also expected to announce new measures to strengthen the use of asbos and fixed penalty notices. there are still concerns that some areas of the country are not using the powers properly.  he is expected to say that the new figures were heartening but he would not rest until similar action was taken in all areas of the country where it was needed.  we have not defeated this problem by any means  but shown together what can be done   he will say. mr blair this week defended the shake-up of the licensing laws  saying it was right to focus on troublemakers rather than treating everybody as a potential drunken nuisance.  ministers also boast of record police numbers and are speeding up plans to put in place 25 000 community support officers (csos). but researchers from leeds university warned that csos could undermine traditional bonds between police officers and communities. more work needed to be done on clarifying the role of different agencies and how they linked together before csos  they argued in a the study. critics of the government say it has announced more than 20 initiatives to tackle nuisance behaviour when the real focus should be on good policing. home office minister hazel blears also revealed this week that  about a third  of asbos were breached - with some people jailed and others not.
politics,ukip outspent labour on eu poll the uk independence party outspent both labour and the liberal democrats in the european elections  new figures show.  ukip  which campaigned on a slogan of  say no to europe   spent Â£2.36m on the campaign - second only to the conservatives  Â£3.13m. the campaign took ukip into third place with an extra 10 meps. labour s campaign cost Â£1.7m  the lib dems  Â£1.19m and the greens  Â£404 000  according to figures revealed by the electoral commission on wednesday. much of the ukip funding came from yorkshire millionaire sir paul sykes  who helped bankroll the party s billboard campaign. critics have accused the party of effectively buying votes. but a ukip spokesman said labour and the conservatives had spent Â£10m between them on the last general election.  with the advantages of public money the others have  the only way the smaller parties can get their message across is by buying the advertising space   he added.
politics,royal couple watch nation s mood prince charles and camilla parker bowles are awaiting the nation s reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 april.  mrs parker bowles will take the title hrh duchess of cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at windsor castle. a daily telegraph poll of 1 313 people suggests two-thirds of britons support the couple s decision to marry. but only 40% think mrs parker bowles should become princess consort as planned after charles becomes king. some 47% believe she should have no title  while 7% think she should become queen.  the poll also found that the majority of britons would prefer the monarchy to miss a generation  with the queen handing the throne to her grandson prince william  22  on her death or abdication. on thursday night  prince charles  56  and mrs parker bowles  57  hosted a dinner at windsor castle  their first public appearance since announcing their engagement. mrs parker bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added:  i m just coming down to earth.  she displayed her diamond engagement ring - a royal family heirloom - to reporters. charles said he and his wife-to-be were  absolutely delighted . their marriage will end years of speculation on a relationship which dates back to 1970.  the queen and duke of edinburgh said the news had made them  very happy . princes william and harry said they are  very happy  and wish the couple  all the luck in the future . the wedding will be a civil ceremony followed by a service of prayer and dedication in st george s chapel at which the archbishop of canterbury  dr rowan williams  will preside.  the marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because mrs parker bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive. if he became king  charles would be the supreme governor of the church of england and some anglicans remain opposed to the remarriage of divorcees.  his divorce from diana and the disappointment the country felt over how diana had been treated... opened up a sense of disillusionment with [prince charles]   said ros coward  who wrote the authorised biography of diana  princess of wales. the archbishop of canterbury said:  i am pleased that prince charles and mrs camilla parker bowles have decided to take this important step.  tony blair said he was  delighted  for the couple and offered his congratulations  as did conservative leader michael howard and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy. australia s prime minister john howard also offered his congratulations  adding that their decision to marry was a  sensible and a good thing . mrs parker bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for the prince s trust. clarence house staff were at pains to point out that she attended these events in a private capacity.

sport,radcliffe yet to answer gb call paula radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the world cross-country championships.  the 31-year-old is concerned the event  which starts on 19 march in france  could upset her preparations for the london marathon on 17 april.  there is no question that paula would be a huge asset to the gb team   said zara hyde peters of uk athletics.  but she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training.  radcliffe must make a decision by tuesday - the deadline for team nominations. british team member hayley yelling said the team would understand if radcliffe opted out of the event.  it would be fantastic to have paula in the team   said the european cross-country champion.  but you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus.  she is not messing us around. we all understand the problem.  radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year s event because of injury. in her absence  the gb team won bronze in brussels.
sport,all black magic: new zealand rugby playing colours:  all black  the haka and more!  the all blacks  charles john munro discovered rugby at london s christ college  and on his return to nelson he staged new zealand s first game. nelson town met nelson college on 14 may  1870  the town triumphing by two goals to nil  instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country s sporting passions. the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread  the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport s warrior ethos. in 1888 a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia  and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex-pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team.  twenty-two maori and four  pakiha  formed the  new zealand native team   who played a total of 107 matches in new zealand  australia and the uk. the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society  even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the maori war dance  the haka! the other great symbol of new zealand rugby  the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast  was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in 1893. new zealand played their first international against australia in 1903  the kiwis triumphing 22-3 in sydney  and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time. the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain  david revell bedell-sivright  created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude. the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in wellington  sparking great celebrations across the country  but bedell-sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk.  their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official new zealand tour to europe. the tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking  inventive approach  but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a  roving  forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. the tactic was effective  two late tries seeing the kiwis to a 12-7 win over scotland  before ireland were despatched 15-0 in dublin. a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of england. new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first  golden age   and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at cardiff arms park  but post-match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas. dallas said that deans was tackled short  but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed:  i did score that try in cardiff.   four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed  all golds  rugby league side soon after the tour  but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo-welsh touring team in 1908. the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-test series  starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the all blacks  inclusion of maori players. the awesome 1924-5 all black tourists became known as  the invincibles  after winning all 30 of their games in france  britain and ireland  including a crushing 19-0 victory over wales at st helen s. despite their success  the all blacks  2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times  and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928. employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the new zealand  rover  system for the first time  south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two-all. the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour (a series won 3-1 by new zealand)  the lions manager describing the tactic as  cheating   prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.  the all blacks  1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage  schoolboy half-backs hayden tanner and willie davies. a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 13-12  although the winning try from geoffrey rees-jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build-up. new zealand s next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to cardiff and drew 6-6 at swansea. the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park  but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous  match-winning try. the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations  before a 19-5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller. new zealand built from that tour  and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.  that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at rodney parade. wilson whinneray s side rallied to beat wales 6-0  their first win at the arms park in four attempts  and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour  but when they returned home the first question put to them was:  what happened in newport   the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales  as they beat the full wales team 13-6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969  the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team.  a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the all blacks  a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of 1971.  james guided llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at stradey park  though  and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23-11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. new zealand defeated a wales xv 12-3 at the arms park in a non-cap game in 1974  but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.  wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line-out. television pictures clearly showed that he dived  but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty  duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 13-12 win. since that infamous game  the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. a crushing 23-3 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union s 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 49-6 in brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural world cup. the kiwis went on to claim the cup  and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of new zealand.  a young  talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners  but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games  wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game  but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of wales  best players - chose to head north to rugby league.  a 34-9 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989  and at the 1995 world cup wales  big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg. a crushing 42-7 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997  and as wales  misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen. there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game  but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff s new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.  a bruising 55-3 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup  but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope. wales were given no chance going into the game  but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. new zealand rallied to a 53-37 win  but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen  coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. they have a chance  but clearly history is not on their side.
health,"the vast majority of the tens of thousands of patients in the uk who have tested positive for covid-19 will be counting their lucky stars that they have had only a mild encounter with the deadly virus â€” but they may not be able to relax just yet.  there is growing evidence from china, where the virus originated, and from italy, the first european country to report cases, that patients diagnosed with even a mild case of covid-19 may be left struggling with long-term health problems long after the virus has left their bodies.  'what we have been seeing in hospitals is the tip of the iceberg,' professor roberto pedretti, head of cardiology at the clinical scientific institute in pavia, italy, told good health.  'our focus at the moment is treating patients at the acute stage to help them recover from covid-19. but we also need to consider the future health impacts of the virus.'  one of these is potential long-term lung damage, which professor pedretti fears is going to leave health services worldwide struggling to cope with increasing numbers of covid-19 survivors who are disabled by reduced lung capacity and require extensive rehabilitation to restore their quality of life.  patients diagnosed with even a mild case of covid-19 may be left struggling with long-term health problems long after the virus has left their bodies  in severe cases, sars-cov-2 (the virus that causes covid-19 infection) gets deep into the lungs, inflaming the tiny air sacs and filling them with fluid. this prevents the air sacs doing their job of transferring oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream and taking carbon dioxide out.  this is pneumonia, which in many cases of covid-19 has been found to affect both lungs. as it progresses, patients struggle to breathe, leading to the potentially fatal condition acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) â€” where the lungs become severely inflamed.  many patients affected are unable to breathe unassisted and need to be put on a ventilator.  even when covid-19 patients recover from ards, they may be left with pulmonary fibrosis â€” scarring of the lung tissue, which can lead to increasing breathlessness.  several recent studies have highlighted the growing evidence that covid-19 causes fibrosis. a research paper published in a chinese journal in march reported that 'extensive' evidence suggests that 'pulmonary fibrosis may be one of the major [long-term] complications in covid-19 patients'.  this echoes the findings of a study in wuhan, china â€” ground zero for the coronavirus â€” where researchers analysed the ct scans of 81 patients with covid-19 and found signs of fibrosis even in those who had had no symptoms, such as a cough or a high temperature (but who had tested positive for the disease).  in the journal lancet infectious diseases in april, researchers said it was unclear if these lung changes were 'irreversible'.  not just a risk for hospital patients  health authorities in hong kong revealed in march that among the first dozen patients who had been discharged from hospital after treatment for severe covid-19, 25 per cent were still suffering from shortness of breath, and 'gasping' when walking a bit more quickly.  despite apparent recovery, 'some patients might have a drop of around 20 to 30 per cent in lung function', says dr owen tsang tak-yin, medical director of the infectious disease centre at princess margaret hospital in hong kong.  the uk's scientific advisory group for emergencies has warned that covid patients could be left with 'extreme tiredness and shortness of breath for several months'.  medical staff transfer a patient of a highly suspected case of a new coronavirus at the queen elizabeth hospital in hong kong, china january 22, 2020  some experts believe that even those who don't require hospital admission could be affected. the chairman of the dutch association of physicians in chest medicine and tuberculosis warned that thousands of people in the netherlands who recovered from covid-19 may be left with permanent damage to their lungs, adding that while many who tested positive weren't ill enough to need hospital care, it was still possible for them to suffer permanent problems.  one theory is that fibrosis occurs as the virus disrupts the wound-healing process. this is what occurred with the sars coronavirus, the forerunner of covid-19, according to a paper published in the journal of virology in 2017.  research published in the journal thorax in 2005 found that six months on, sars survivors' lung function 'was considerably lower than that of a normal population'.part of the problem is the length of time some patients undergo invasive ventilation in intensive care, says ema swingwood, chair of the association of chartered physiotherapists in respiratory care.  those on a ventilator need it for 'much longer' than normal, she says â€” 'up to 14 days or more'. lengthy exposure to high levels of dehumidified oxygen delivered by ventilation can dry out and damage the mucociliary escalator, the mucus and microscopic 'hairs' that help transport secretions and debris up and out of the airway. oxygen delivered non-invasively, through masks or nasal tubes, can have the same effect if used for prolonged periods.  ema says that 'we are seeing a group of patients left with extreme breathlessness and fatigue'.  even fit people have been affected  it is not simply that people in poor health before getting covid-19 suffer worse. 'we're seeing patients we'd never normally expect to see at all who are totally fit and well and have amazing exercise capacity and lung function, and yet they are still suffering lung problems,' says ema.  how much scarring patients develop â€” and how well the lung recovers â€” 'is very difficult to know at the moment', says dr noel baxter, a gp and a medical adviser to asthma uk and the british lung foundation.  'but there are likely to be some people who end up with some sort of long-term problem'.  so does the virus affect our eyes? by alice jaffe the prime ministerâ€™s chief adviser dominic cummings last week claimed he had travelled with his family to barnard castle in county durham â€˜to see if i could drive safelyâ€™. his explanation was that he had thought his vision might have been affected by coronavirus. eye symptoms are recognised as a possible symptom of the disease â€” conjunctivitis, sticky eyes and red eyes have been reported in around a third of patients according to a small study in wuhan, china, published in march. conjunctivitis is also included as a less common symptom in the world health organisationâ€™s official list. but could covid-19 affect vision? robert maclaren, a professor of ophthalmology at oxford university, says: â€˜you would be expected to make a full recovery from the eye problems reported so far, although it may cause temporary difficulties such as blurred vision.â€™ the royal national institute of blind people says: â€˜there is no evidence of sight loss caused directly by the virus,â€™ but noted â€˜research is being carried out into some very rare cases that appear to be secondary to other complications such as blood clots caused by the virusâ€™. advertisement  the british lung foundation and asthma uk have launched the post-covid hub, a website where patients can be put in direct contact with clinicians.  the advice from the foundation for those affected includes techniques for coping with breathlessness and tips on breaking 'unhelpful breathing habits' that can make the problem worse.  for instance, people tend to breathe faster automatically when they feel breathless, and end up using the top of their chest to breathe instead of the whole of the lungs. but this is more tiring for the muscles. the foundation's advice on how to breathe more effectively can be accessed through the post-covid hub website. rehabilitation with a tailored programme of exercise for patients who have had covid-19 will be essential, particularly for patients who have been in intensive care.  but a wider group of people may need help. karen middleton, chief executive of the chartered society of physiotherapy, has predicted that 'in the coming weeks and months, there will be a tidal wave of rehabilitation need'.  professor pedretti has begun trials of a potential new rehabilitation treatment for covid-19 patients unable to exercise enough to restore lung capacity.  the trial will use reoxy machines, which provide interval hypoxic-hyperoxic treatment (ihht). this has been used previously to boost fitness in heart patients.  it involves using an alternating mixture of reduced, then either enriched or normal levels of oxygen, administered through a face mask. intermittently depriving the body of normal levels of oxygen brings about cell changes at a molecular level that make the cardiovascular system more efficient at transporting oxygen.  research published in the journal high altitude medicine & biology in 2018 found that five weeks of ihht training was as effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness in patients as an eight-week conventional exercise programme.  how the virus can harm the heart  evidence is emerging that in some cases the virus may affect the brain, causing seizures and stroke, as well as harming the liver, kidneys, heart and blood vessels.  a paper in the journal jama cardiology in march reported that one in five of 416 covid-19 patients hospitalised in wuhan, china, had suffered heart damage. the researchers also found problems could occur even in those without underlying heart problems.  another study from wuhan published in february noted that of 36 patients transferred to intensive care, 16 (44.4 per cent) were suffering from arrhythmia (irregular heartbeats).  the heart problems are thought to occur as a result of the virus triggering a 'cytokine storm', where the immune system overreacts to the infection, leading to inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis).  as a result, the heart pumps more weakly, causing symptoms such as breathlessness. myocarditis can also affect the heart's electrical system, leading to heart rhythm problems.  'covid-19 can affect the cardiovascular system through multiple pathways,' says dr mohammad madjid, a cardiologist at the university of texas.  'the virus may directly affect the heart muscle, which may not work as strongly as it should, causing the heart rhythm to become irregular.'  in severe cases, he adds, there is a high risk of developing clots, which can cause problems in the heart or lungs and may even lead to a stroke.  yuchi han, an associate professor of medicine and radiology and director of cardiac mri at the perelman centre for advanced medicine at the university of pennsylvania, says that people with heart and vascular conditions seem to have more severe damage from the infection.  dr han co-authored research published in the journal heart in april, which reviewed a series of clinical reports from around the world and concluded that damage to heart muscles 'is common in covid-19 and portends a worse prognosis'.  but people with no history of heart problems appear to be equally vulnerable. he says: 'the inflammation that occurs in the heart is not limited to people who have heart or vascular disease and could occur in anyone. however, we don't yet know why in people who do not have risk factors some experience severe disease and others don't.'  such is the feared scale of the heart problems associated with the virus that on april 23 the national institute for health and care excellence issued urgent guidelines 'to help healthcare professionals who are not cardiology specialists identify and treat acute myocardial injury and its cardiac complications in adults with known or suspected covid-19 but without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease'.  in the first week of the pandemic, professor nicholas hart â€” who treated boris johnson during his battle with covid-19 in st thomas' hospital, london â€” warned that many patients will emerge from the shadow of the immediate threat of the disease only to face a range of long-term problems.  the expert in respiratory and critical care medicine tweeted: 'covid-19 is this generation's polio.'  it was a stark prediction that is now appearing to be worryingly accurate.  see the asthma uk and british lung foundation post-covid-19 hub at post-covid.org.uk.  super-fit mum left at risk of having a heart transplant  amanda cable, 51, a journalist, lives in blackheath, south-east london  amanda cable, 51, a journalist, lives in blackheath, south-east london, with husband ray, 51, a photographer, and their three children ruby, 21, and twins charlie and archie, 18.  by amanda cable for the daily mail  a few days ago, i climbed the stairs in my house, as i have done countless times over the years. when i reached the top â€” after albeit painfully slow progress â€” i paused to reflect on my 'achievement'. the enormity of how life had changed hit me, and i felt tearful.  it's been ten weeks since i fell ill with what at first appeared to be mild coronavirus. since then, i've struggled to walk a few steps, let alone tackle the stairs. i've spent most of my time in bed and any trips downstairs have meant lengthy rests mid-flight.  scaling the 15 steps has become such a symbol of recovery that my cardiologist has told me to make it a measure of my improvement. i was fit and well before i became ill, but i've been warned that as a result of the virus, my health may never recover. i now have heart and lung damage and i've been warned i may one day need a pacemaker or, if i'm really unlucky, a heart transplant.  i fell ill on friday, march 20, when covid-19 felt like a remote nightmare. we'd all had warnings from spain and italy, but like so many others, i watched horrific footage on the news and tried to believe it wouldn't hit the uk as hard.  in truth, i thought i had little to fear. on that day, i went on a three-mile dog walk with ray and felt unusually breathless.  on the monday, i woke with a headache, fever and a sore throat. i wouldn't have even known it was covid-19, save for my strangely swollen left eye â€” which i'd heard was a symptom. i self-isolated at home.  'i fell ill on friday, march 20, when covid-19 felt like a remote nightmare.'  as the days continued, i had mild muscle ache, shivers and a slightly heavy chest. i remarked happily on facebook, 'it's very mild â€” i've been lucky.'  but eight days after my first symptoms, my chest felt heavy and i struggled to breathe. soon after, on the advice of nhs 111, i went to hospital.  at a&e at queen elizabeth hospital, woolwich, a doctor said my symptoms were so textbook â€” they now included a black 'dot' on my toe â€” there was no point testing for the virus, but the doctor did order an electrocardiogram (ecg), which measures the heart's electrical activity.  the technician checked the printed trace, then re-did the test. he sent me straight back to the doctor, who explained it was so erratic i was possibly having a heart attack.  i was rushed for x-rays. a doctor explained i wasn't having a heart attack, covid-19 had caused inflammation to my heart and lungs. i was the third patient that day with similar symptoms. each had been under 60, active and fit. i was sent home on strict bed rest â€” and warned movement could cause more damage to my weakened heart muscle, and that the scarring to my lungs may be permanent.  the change in my health has been difficult to grasp. at times, my breathing has been so laboured i have been utterly convinced i would die. at one point, instead of planning my next birthday, i planned my funeral with my husband.  as i fought for every breath, i kept thinking of the years i would miss. my sons going to university. my daughter marrying, and having children. it felt like my entire life and future had been taken so fast.  i've since seen two more cardiologists and after an ecg and echocardiogram â€” where sound waves create moving images of the heart â€” i have been told the inflammation to my heart has progressed to myocarditis, severe inflammation of the heart muscle.  it affects the heart's electrical system and reduces its ability to pump. it's now associated with covid-19 and can lead to heart failure, heart attack, stroke, or sudden death.  i'm assured that in many cases myocarditis improves on its own. some cases require medication, surgical treatment â€” for instance, a pacemaker â€” and in rare cases, heart transplant. and yes, there's a chance that could be me.  so here i am all these weeks later hoping my heart mends and trying to rebuild my fitness. the scarring to my lungs makes breathing painful and stiff. i await an mri scan to look for signs of permanent damage. my breathlessness affects my ability to talk, and a sore throat limits conversation.  there are other knock-on effects, too. a few weeks ago, i started having strange stabbing pains in my left leg, so i'd dramatically collapse, clasping my thigh, like a cowboy who had been shot."
health,"this week in the daily mail, dr michael mosley is setting out a health revolution that will put you on course to staying one step ahead of coronavirus as lockdown eases.  in exclusive extracts from his new book covid-19, he will help you get in the best shape to fight the virus.  today, he explains why having a healthy gut is crucial to your wellbeing.  this week in the daily mail, dr michael mosley (above) is setting out a health revolution that will put you on course to staying one step ahead of coronavirus as lockdown eases  like any army, your immune system needs feeding to work efficiently and destroy any potentially dangerous invaders such as the coronavirus.  eating a diet rich in vitamins and minerals is key here. but did you know you also need to include foods that will support the trillions of microbes living in your gut?  the â€˜gut microbiomeâ€™ is the scientific name for the 2-3 lb of microbes that live in our intestines, and today, in the second part of a groundbreaking series from my new book covid-19, i will reveal why gut bacteria are so important when it comes to protecting you from the life-threatening complications of covid-19.  a healthy microbiome should be diverse, but sadly, our modern way of eating is decimating the populations that live inside us.  one of the problems is, the more limited the range of foods you eat, the more limited your bacterial diversity is likely to be. many of us eat such a narrow range of foods that our gut bacteria are forced to exist on a restricted diet. and it doesnâ€™t make them happy.  eating lots of processed food, junk food, and unnecessary doses of antibiotics, has laid waste to our microbiome. the emulsifiers added to processed foods in order to extend their shelf life are a problem, too. these detergent derivatives have been shown to reduce microbial richness.  this couldnâ€™t be more important right now because studies have shown our microbiome plays a vital role in the proper training and functioning of your immune system.  having a diverse microbiome is good because it means you have a wide range of different microbes in your gut and the â€˜badâ€™ ones, that do things like encourage inflammation, are in the minority  iâ€™m a big fan of a mediterranean-style diet, which is rich in healthy natural fats, nuts and fish, as well as vegetables and legumes packed with disease-fighting vitamins and minerals.  not only does it taste great, but it is regularly voted by health professionals as the healthiest diet on the planet.  there is so much scientific evidence that adopting this lifestyle will cut your risk of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, depression and dementia. but now we also know it will improve the workings of your immune system as well.  one of the reasons why the mediterranean diet is so super healthy is because it boosts levels of the â€˜goodâ€™ microbes in your gut, which play an important role in the bodyâ€™s immune response to infectious pathogens such as coronaviruses.  stock up on seaweed edible seaweeds (sold as dried nori sheets) or coastal plant samphire, are excellent prebiotics packed with vitamins, minerals, fibre and omega-3 fatty acids. studies showed that people who took a daily seaweed capsule over six weeks saw an increase in 15 different types of â€˜friendlyâ€™ bacteria in their gut. the easiest way to incorporate seaweed into your meal is to sprinkle dried nori sheets into soups and stews and over salads to give them a tangy, salty taste. or you can snack on mini sheets of dried seaweed, like itsu sea- weed thins, which are low calorie but high in vitamin b12, iodine, protein and fibre, making them the perfect snack for your good gut bacteria. studies showed that people who took a daily seaweed capsule over six weeks saw an increase in 15 different types of â€˜friendlyâ€™ bacteria in their gut [file photo] advertisement  one reason is the impact that these â€˜goodâ€™ bacteria have on chronic inflammation. inflammation isnâ€™t always a bad thing. if you cut your finger the inflammatory process makes it feel hot and swollen as your body repairs the damage and keeps infection out.  however, as we get older, inflammation can start to spread throughout the body, becoming chronic and widespread. when that happens it can damage your dna, scar your blood vessels, age your skin and kill off healthy cells. it is linked to a whole range of diseases, including heart disease, cancer and dementia.  but a healthy diet can prevent much of this happening, and one of the ways it does this is by feeding the â€˜goodâ€™ bacteria that live in your gut. they, in turn, are very good at turning fibre and other nutrients in your diet into chemicals called short-chain fatty acids (scfs), which reduce inflammation in the body.  if you are overweight, have type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, asthma or arthritis â€” any of the very typical 21st-century diseases â€” then you are very likely to have chronic inflammation.  unfortunately, this means your immune system will also have become less effective.  not only will your army of fighters be slow to react to a covid-19 infection, and ill-equipped to fight it, but chronic inflammation means your immune system could also be more likely to overreact and cause very serious damage instead.  most people who get covid-19 get either no symptoms or experience a relatively mild illness which can be effectively treated at home. but the complications that lead to an ambulance trip to hospital, and a possible stay in intensive care, can be caused by a malfunction of the immune system called a â€˜cytokine stormâ€™.  this typically happens within ten days of first noticing symptoms. if your body has not managed to subdue the virus by then, it may instead start to overreact and attack healthy tissue as well as cells infected with the virus. this can lead to extensive damage to the heart, lungs and other organs. it can ultimately lead to death.  we now know that people who already have chronic inflammation are more likely to suffer from a â€˜cytokine stormâ€™. which could help explain why overweight people, and those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, are more likely to die.  before embarking on a diet packed with vegetables, pulses, wholegrains and seaweed, itâ€™s a good idea to assess the state of your microbiome [file photo]  this is also why a healthy mix of gut microbes is so important. the â€˜goodâ€™ guys produce chemicals that reduce chronic inflammation and so help reduce the risk of a â€˜cytokine stormâ€™.  they are like firefighters who help put out the blazes that would otherwise destroy your body. but, be warned, there are also plenty of â€˜badâ€™ microbes living in your guts â€” these are more like arsonists setting fires.  if you havenâ€™t been eating a healthy diet and established a good mix of anti-inflammatory gut bacteria, thereâ€™s a risk your immune system lacks the resilience and diversity that is required to establish balanced immune responses.  the importance of a healthy microbiome was illustrated by a recent study of more than 900 people who had covid-19, some of whom developed severe symptoms, while in others the effects were mild.  the researchers found that studying the patientsâ€™ microbiome was one of the best ways of predicting who would get seriously ill and who would not.  as well as reducing chronic inflammation, a healthy, diverse microbiome will also help you maintain a healthy weight and keep your blood sugar levels down.  the mix of microbes in your gut can affect how much energy your body extracts from the food you eat; they generate their own hunger signals; they may help decide which foods you crave; they also help to determine how much your blood sugar spikes in response to a meal.  the link is clear when you know that people who are seriously overweight or have type 2 diabetes are at twice the risk of becoming seriously ill if they get covid-19.  so now, more than ever, you want to be sure your gut microbiome is fighting for you, rather than against you.  switch to a sunshine diet the good news is that you can change the balance of your microbiome in a very short period of time by switching to a mediterranean diet. this will not only bolster your immune system by improving your microbiome, but it means you will be getting the full spread of vitamins and minerals that your body also needs to fight the virus. hereâ€™s how: eat natural healthy fats in the form of real food, such as olive oil, salmon, tuna, full-fat dairy, avocado, nuts and seeds. these natural fats are also good for the waist and the heart, and will keep you feeling full for longer.  eat decent amounts of protein such as oily fish (salmon, mackerel), seafood, chicken, some red meat, eggs, tofu, beans, pulses, dairy and nuts. you need at least 50-60g of protein a day, every day. as you get older, you need more. restrict your intake of processed meats such as sausages, bacon and salami, as most contain high levels of salt, nitrates and other preservatives which your gut bacteria donâ€™t love.  eat plenty of dark green and coloured veg. these are very low in calories and contain many essential vitamins and nutrients. they also contain lots of fibre, which the â€˜goodâ€™ microbes in your gut will benefit from. experiment with different types of fruit or vegetables (your gut bacteria loves variety).  swap white pasta and rice for wholegrains and pulses which are rich in fibre. choose multigrain, seeded or rye bread over white. again, the good bacteria in your gut will thrive on the fibre in these foods. if youâ€™re trying to lose weight, you should keep your intake of carbs down.  avoid snacking between meals or late-night grazing. grazing stops fat burning. if you must, snack on non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli, cucumber or celery, or a small handful of nuts or a small piece of cheese. fruit is not a good choice, particularly when you are trying to lose weight. Ã· cut right back on sugar or sweeteners.  reduce your intake of processed food, junk food, ready meals and takeaways, tempting though they may be during these stressful times. eating lots of sugary or processed foods will just reinforce and feed the â€˜badâ€™, pro-inflammatory microbes that live in your gut.  drink healthily. plenty of black tea, fruit tea, black coffee and water. as for alcohol, an occasional glass of red wine with a meal is ok, but donâ€™t overdo it.  how good is your digestion?  before embarking on a diet packed with vegetables, pulses, wholegrains and seaweed, itâ€™s a good idea to assess the state of your microbiome.  this quiz will tell you if youâ€™re likely to have a healthy population of â€˜goodâ€™ bacteria which may just need supporting (with meals packed with prebiotic foods) and topping up (with probiotic foods, such as live yoghurt or sauerkraut).  it could also indicate that your microbiome is in poor shape, dominated by pro-inflammatory microbes which might be driving lethargy, weight gain, mood swings and even health problems.  having a diverse microbiome is good because it means you have a wide range of different microbes in your gut and the â€˜badâ€™ ones, that do things like encourage inflammation, are in the minority.  but problems occur, and your immune system becomes compromised if one group â€” say, the ones who thrive on junk food â€” start to dominate. these bad guys can swiftly become much more influential and, by producing chemical signals, induce anxiety, cravings and inflammation.  if you have recurrent gut problems, you might suspect your microbiome isnâ€™t happy, but often you have become so accustomed to being out of kilter that mild digestive discomfort â€” and the low mood, pain and bloating that come with it â€” has become just â€˜normalâ€™.  take this quiz to find out. if you answer yes, that counts as one point. add up your totals then discover, in the panel on the right, what this says about your gut health.  sleep and weight gain  an unhappy microbiome can affect your ability to sleep well, and can make you prone to weight gain, too.  poor sleep means you produce more of the stress hormone, cortisol, and more of the hunger hormones that drive appetite.  you are more likely to eat badly because poor sleep cranks up your desire for sugary carbohydrates and high-fat snacks, which, in turn, encourage a shift towards the growth of â€˜badâ€™ microbes in your gut.  i donâ€™t sleep well.  i rarely seem to be able to shake off feelings of tiredness.  my weight has steadily crept up over the years.  losing weight is a battle.  poor sleep means you produce more of the stress hormone, cortisol, and more of the hunger hormones that drive appetite [file photo]  mood barometer  the microbiome also influences our brains. in fact, a network of neurons in your gut communicates directly with the brain via a superfast â€˜broadbandâ€™ connection called the vagus nerve.  studies show that people who suffer from depression and anxiety often have gut problems.  changing your diet will increase levels of healthy bacteria, which then produce chemicals that help improve mood.  these include serotonin and gaba (a neurotransmitter that acts in a similar way to the anti-anxiety drug, valium).  i can be pretty moody at times.  i am prone to anxiety.  i get brain fog and sometimes find it difficult to think straight.  digestion troubles  having an unbalanced microbiome, with too many â€˜badâ€™ bacteria producing chemicals that help inflame the lining of the gut, is called dysbiosis.  common symptoms include constipation, diarrhoea, bloating, fatigue, anxiety and depression.  i frequently get gut pain.  i have irritable bowel syndrome.  bloating and trapped wind are problems for me.  i frequently have constipation or diarrhoea.  iâ€™m prone to indigestion.  childhood links  studies show that children who are born by caesarean section and those who are not breastfed as babies can grow up with a less diverse population of gut bacteria.  you inherit your gut bacteria from your mother, gulping them down as you travel along the birth canal and out into a bright new world.  if you are born by caesarean section this doesnâ€™t happen.  similarly, breastfeeding naturally introduces you to a wide variety of bacteria from your mother.  additionally, a restricted diet of processed foods will lead to a limited microbiome population in later life.  i was born by c-section.  i wasnâ€™t breastfed.  i have always been a fussy eater.  i was brought up on a diet mainly of junk/processed food.  studies show that children who are born by caesarean section and those who are not breastfed as babies can grow up with a less diverse population of gut bacteria [file photo]  medical issues  as well as a poor diet, being stressed, taking too many antibiotics and certain other medications can all cause inflammation in the gut wall, which protects your body from all the microbes that enter your body, along with food. inflammation, in turn, can weaken the gut wall leading to â€˜leaky gut syndromeâ€™.  this compromises your ability to absorb the nutrients in your diet and allows bacteria and other toxins to escape from your gut into your blood causing all sorts of health problems, compromised immunity and skin problems.  i have taken antibiotics multiple times.  i have raised blood sugar levels.  i am prone to more colds than most people.  i am prone to skin rashes or thrush.  my skin is bad (eczema, psoriasis, acne)  eating habits  the drugs given to the animals we eat to encourage them to gain weight, and the emulsifiers added to processed foods in order to extend their shelf life, combine to reduce microbial richness.  if you eat fast, and on the move, it is likely you are eating a lot of junk.  iâ€™m not great with vegetables and rarely eat three portions a day.  i eat very quickly and often on the run.  i often eat in front of the tv.  i have no time to cook from scratch so have to rely on processed food.  food preferences  good gut bacteria thrive on variety, but 75 per cent of the worldâ€™s food comes from just 12 plants and five animal species.  and most families eat from a limited repertoire of meals with a boringly small range of ingredients â€” doing this will really limit your microbial diversity.  because the microbiome can influence how much your blood sugar levels rise when you eat, this can have an impact on cravings and appetite control. some bacteria thrive on sugar, others love fat.  they can manipulate behaviour and mood, changing taste receptors, producing toxins to make us feel bad and releasing chemical rewards to make us feel good.  they even manufacture a range of chemicals that are strikingly similar to the main hunger hormones that control our appetite.  i tend to have the same breakfast every morning.  i like the same sandwiches for lunch every day.  dinner for me will be one of less than ten options.  i stick to the same supermarket shopping list each week.  i have strong cravings for coffee/sugar/alcohol.  iâ€™m a chocaholic.  good gut bacteria thrive on variety, but 75 per cent of the worldâ€™s food comes from just 12 plants and five animal species [file photo]  now find out what your score means zero to five points congratulations! you and your gut bacteria are clearly a happy team. keep up the good digestive work â€” continue experimenting with different foods and try adding fermented foods into your diet which are rich in probiotics, living bacteria. although there is no direct evidence that they will benefit your immunity, they are a useful way of boosting your â€˜goodâ€™ bacteria. one note of caution: if you have not eaten fermented foods before, start with small amounts or you might get some gastrointestinal symptoms initially, such as bloating or gas. five to ten points you probably feel ok most of the time, but itâ€™s probable your biome isnâ€™t as happy as it could be. eating a wider variety of vegetables and other gut-friendly foods will help build the armies of â€˜goodâ€™ bacteria. ensure thereâ€™s more colour on your plate. colour is a great indicator of nutritional diversity. thatâ€™s because the pigments plants produce not only give them their colour, scent and flavour, but also means they contain hundreds of different bioactive compounds known as phytonutrients. these phytonutrients tend to be concentrated in the skins of fruits and vegetables. their role in the plant is, among other things, to protect it against fungi and bacteria. but they also have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. phytonutrients in fruit and vegetables come in a range of colours â€” green, yellow-orange, red, blue-purple and white. the key is to eat a wide variety of colours, aiming for two or more of each per day. over ten points if you scored ten or more in my quiz, thereâ€™s a chance your gut might be struggling. you probably know if things arenâ€™t quite right. it might be griping stomach pain, or bloating, occasional nausea or frequent trips to the bathroom (or not going often enough). the lining of your intestine can be inflamed, or hyper-sensitive and vulnerable to damage by infections, some medications, an overactive immune system (which can lead to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease) and a poor diet. if you have major gut problems talk to your gp first. but evidence is emerging that a change to a mediterranean-based diet that encourages the growth of â€˜goodâ€™ bacteria, might help matters. we know, for example, that as well as shielding your gut from attack, some of the â€˜goodâ€™ gut bacteria produce chemicals which actually reduce inflammation and help to reinforce your gut wall. you should always discuss any gut-related symptoms with your gp (to exclude the possibility of a serious illness). if you suspect you might have problems or dietary sensitivities, i recommend you try a â€˜remove and repairâ€™ protocol for a few weeks to allow any gut inflammation to calm down before launching into a more gut-friendly diet that will help bolster your immunity.  remove and repair  before bombarding your gut with more vegetables and pulses than it is used to, give it the chance to heal first.  one good way is to cut out any potential â€˜irritantsâ€™ from your diet, then gradually re-introduce them to allow your â€˜goodâ€™ gut bacteria to re-populate.  troublesome foods include gluten, pulses, milk, eggs, soya, coffee and alcohol.  when your symptoms have settled, slowly re-introduce trigger foods one at a time with a gap of at least three days.  keep a food and symptom diary to track your bodyâ€™s response to foods so you know which ones to target.  like any army, your immune system needs feeding to work efficiently and destroy any potentially dangerous invaders such as the coronavirus. eating a diet rich in vitamins and minerals is key here

adding â€˜resistant starchâ€™ to your diet. this is a type of starch that, as its name implies, resists digestion in your stomach and small intestine. once it reaches the large intestine, it feeds the â€˜goodâ€™ bacteria which digest it, releasing butyrate which reduces inflammation and strengthens the gut wall. youâ€™ll find lots of resistant starch in grains, seeds (such as flaxseeds) and legumes, unripe bananas and green peas. but one of the more surprising places you will find some of it is in pasta or rice that has been cooked and cooled as this changes the structure of the starch, making it more resistant to digestion. studies have shown that if you boil rice with a bit of coconut oil, cool it down, then reheat it in a microwave, you can increase the levels of resistant starch roughly 15-fold. eating rice this way could halve the amount of calories your gut will absorb from it. studies have shown that if you boil rice with a bit of coconut oil, cool it down, then reheat it

politics,fox attacks blair s tory  lies  tony blair lied when he took the uk to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign  say the tories.  tory co-chairman liam fox was speaking after mr blair told labour members the tories offered a  hard right agenda . dr fox told bbc radio:  if you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war  i guess you are going to lie about anything at all.  he would not discuss reports the party repaid Â£500 000 to lord ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.  the prime minister ratcheted up labour s pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party s spring conference. he insisted he did not know the poll date  but it is widely expected to be 5 may.  in what was seen as a highly personal speech in gateshead on sunday  mr blair said:  i have the same passion and hunger as when i first walked through the door of 10 downing street.  he described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric  then struggling to live up to the expectations  and reaching the point of raised voices and  throwing crockery . he warned his supporters against complacency  saying:  it s a fight for the future of our country  it s a fight that for britain and the people of britain we have to win.   mr blair said that whether the public chose michael howard or mr kennedy  it would result in  a tory government not a labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward . dr fox accused mr blair and other cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents  policies and then attacking the lies.  what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and it s going to be fear and smear   he told bbc news. the tory co-chairman attacked labour s six new pledges as  vacuous  and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid Â£500 000 to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election.  we repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters   he said  insisting he enjoyed a  warm and constructive  relationship to lord ashcroft.  meanwhile lib dem leader charles kennedy is expected to attack mr blair s words as he begins a nationwide tour on monday. mr kennedy is accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester  liverpool  leicester  somerset  basingstoke  shrewsbury  dorset and torbay. he said:  this is three-party politics. in the northern cities  the contest is between labour and the liberal democrats.  in southern and rural seats - especially in the south west - the principal contenders are the liberal democrats and the conservatives  who are out of the running in scotland and wales.  the lib dems accuse mr blair of making a  touchy-feely  speech to labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.
politics,tsunami  won t divert africa aid  uk aid to help the victims of the asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from africa  prime minister tony blair has promised.  mr blair told the bbc s breakfast with frost show the money spent on the tsunami would not  invade  the money britain wanted to spend on africa. questioned about the disaster  he said his faith in god had not been shaken. he added he would give new figures on the number of tsunami-related british deaths to the commons on monday. foreign secretary jack straw said on friday that about 440 britons were either dead or missing in the disaster.  mr blair told sunday s programme:  since jack straw gave those figures a couple of days ago they haven t moved a great deal  which should give us some hope that we are beginning to reach the peak of the numbers. but we just can t be sure.  it is just an immensely difficult job to get absolutely accurate figures  all countries are struggling with this.   he said the Â£50 million originally allocated from the department for international development was now  well on the way  to being spent. but the exact allocation could not be clarified until the world bank had completed its assessment of the needs of the countries affected. within the next few weeks a clearer picture would emerge of the long-term costs of reconstruction  he added. but he pledged that africa - which sees a  preventable  tsunami-size death toll every month from conflict  disease and poverty - would not be neglected. as britain takes up its presidency of the g8 group of leading nations  mr blair said ministers had a big agenda for africa.  for the first time we have a plan that won t just deal with aid and debt but will also deal on issues of governance within african countries and conflict resolution   he said.  a lot of the problems in africa come from conflict  that again are preventable  but only with the right systems in place.
politics,falconer rebuts  charade  claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia  through the back door  were not a political ploy  the lord chancellor has said.  ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday. lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer. he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear.  the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves. ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards. critics fear it could allow  killing by omission  through withdrawing treatment  including food and fluids.  tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill. but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland.  it is important we don t end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen   he said.  on tuesday  the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203  despite rebellion by 34 labour mps. the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill. but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark. eventually  he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes  prompting claims of a shambles. the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been.  lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords. he told bbc news:  we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life.  the motive has got to be to end suffering.  he denied the concessions were a  political manoeuvre  forced by panic about the rebellion. it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a  sensible solution   he said.  i don t think it is something to be embarrassed about. these issues are not easy to deal with   he went on. bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was  waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast  after his performance. but lord falconer praised his minister for an  excellent job . former conservative leader iain duncan smith  one of the chief critics of the plans  condemned the debate as a  charade  and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague.
politics,brown  proud of economy record  gordon brown has delivered a rousing speech to labour s spring conference setting out the government s agenda for the next general election.  the chancellor said he was proud of his party s record on the economy  and would strive for continuing stability if elected. the gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes. and the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. later  prime minister tony blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail.  analysing mr brown s position before the speech  bbc correspondent james hardy said mr brown would draw  sharp dividing lines  with the conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. he would contrast labour s plan to invest Â£60bn in services with a tory plan to cut spending by Â£35bn.  mr brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade   our correspondent said.  on friday night  mr brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the labour manifesto had been published after the budget  expected in march. but commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether  as the conservatives claim  he plans to raise tax after the election. the tories accuse labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997.  following the chancellor s keynote speech  the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on saturday. mr blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected may election. capital radio dj margherita taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. the prime minister s enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed  alan milburn  labour s election strategist told radio 4 s today programme on saturday. mr blair has  the same passion and the same commitments for the job  as when labour came to power in 1997  he said.  and he confirmed mr blair s insistence that no poll date had yet been set. he said:  i m the general election co-ordinator and i don t know  and tony has not made up his mind.  on friday  the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of england  during which he unveiled his party s six pre-election pledges. starting in london  he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were labour s achievements on the economy  crime  education and public services. the conservatives and lib dems said the pledges - set to underpin labour s election campaign - were  worthless .
politics,mps assess scots fishing industry a group of mps are on a two-day fact-finding mission to scotland to gather evidence for a report into the uk s fishing industry.  members of westminster s environment  food and rural affairs committee will be touring fish markets and talking to fish processors. they will also talk to fisheries minister ross finnie and scientists. mps are deciding whether to recommend a new system of  community quotas  to conserve fish stocks. the aim is that fishing ports like peterhead or fraserburgh would be allocated a quota and local people would decide how to fish it. the scheme is a variation on the local management committees already being established by the european union.  details are contained in a royal commission report for the uk government  along with the more controversial idea of closing some mixed fishing grounds completely. six members of the committee will be in scotland to seek views from fishermen and processors in aberdeen and peterhead. they will also speak to mr finnie  representatives of the royal society and the sea fish industry authority. committee chairman austin mitchell said some way has to be found of harvesting mixed fisheries without wasting stocks.

politics,mcconnell details scots wave toll at least three people from scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list  the first minister has told msps.  the figures came out during a statement by jack mcconnell to the scottish parliament on wednesday. he formally expressed scotland s sympathy for the victims of the indian ocean tidal wave which killed 150 000. mr mcconnell went on to promise that scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort. he said the provisional figures on the dead and lost had been provided by the police.  mr mcconnell said the tragedy should persuade everyone to step up the fight against global poverty and change the world for the better. he said he was proud of the generous response of people in scotland to the disaster appeal  which is expected soon to top Â£20m. the first minister also praised scottish water for immediately flying bottled water and five large generators to the disaster zone. the scottish executive has seconded 11 staff to the aid agencies.  but he said scotland was  in it for the long term  with help planned for fishing communities  for children s services  and for the aid charities. he said 2005 must be the year that scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world  whether in asia or in africa. mr mcconnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the make poverty history campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities  trade unions and churches in the run-up to the g8 summit in gleneagles in july. edinburgh architect  dominic stephenson  became the first scot to be confirmed as a victim of the asian tsunami. the 27-year-old was holidaying on the thai island of koh phi phi with eileen lee  24. she is still missing.
politics,uk rebate  unjustified  - chirac french president jacques chirac has called the uk s Â£3bn rebate from the european union  unjustified .  speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the eu would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. earlier foreign secretary jack straw said the uk was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in 1984. he said it remained justified because less eu farm money came to the uk.  mr chirac told reporters in brussels:  one can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the british cheque. it can no longer be justified. it was from the past.  but a uk government official responded:  even with the rebate  the uk pays two and a half times more than france contributes to the eu budget. without it we would pay 14 times as much as france.  there can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.   the 25-member eu is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013  with the bloc s luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a june summit. earlier conservative graham brady said the rebate was a  crucial test  of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for britain. eu commission president jose manuel barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. mr straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the uk wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.  the uk  france  germany  austria  the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states  combined national incomes - the european commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. mr straw has said the eu commission s proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. shadow europe minister mr brady said:  i believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and i think it s a crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe.   the uk is already one of the biggest net contributors to the eu .  the foreign secretary meanwhile said the  justice  of the rebate remained.  we have one of the lowest net receipts of any eu country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency.  that continues to be the case.   uk independence party leader roger knapman said the rebate was  set in stone  and there was no reason to negotiate about it.  it is extraordinary to do it at this time  just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the eu. if we lose our rebate as well  the british taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that i think everyone will go off the european project.  eu leaders are holding talks in brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish european economy. uk prime minister tony blair is meeting his eu counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the european constitution. the plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. critics - including germany and france - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in eastern europe  undercutting large eu economies and undermining social protections. there are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern european countries who will head west  exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in germany.  mr straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate.  european countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods   he said.  what we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services.  britain s low unemployment meant there was less  neurosis  about people coming from eastern european countries.  in countries like germany and france  where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment  there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in   he said.
health,"the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) released new guidelines on wednesday, recommending all babies born to women with confirmed or suspected coronavirus infections be tested for the disease.  although such cases are rare, infants are at greater risk of contracting serious cases of the virus in comparison with older children.  this is because their immune systems are not yet fully developed and they have smaller airways, which makes them more likely to suffer from breathing problems.  however, very few studies have been performed on babies' risks and doctors are often making medical decisions baed on anecdotal reports.  he cdc is advising that newborns be separated from mothers who have confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus. pictured: diana garcia garcia hold her baby, danaey, for the first time at mount sinai south nassau hospital in oceanside, new york, as her husband, manuel carchipulla, who tested positive for coronavirus, watches, april 28  babies should be tested within the first 24 hours and can be reunited with their mothers if the women test negative (file image)  according to the cdc, newborns can become infected either through respiratory droplets from their mother during childbirth or exposure to sick staff or visitors after delivery.  there is currently no evidence that covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, can reach a baby via the umbilical cord.  the cdc recommends that infants be tested within the first 24 hours, and be isolated from other babies that already tested negative.  health officials also recommend that the babies be isolated from their mothers until the women test negative.  if newborns do contract the virus, many experience the same symptoms as adults such as coughing, fever, diarrhea and shortness of breath.  but there have been some case reports of babies needing to placed on ventilators.  in a chinese study of 2,143 children with confirmed or suspected cases of covid-19 from late december to early february, more than 10 percent of infants had severe or critical illness.  comparatively, rates were seven percent for children from ages one to five, about four percent for kids between ages six and 10, and seven percent for children 11 years old or older.  the cdc adds that newborns don't need a negative coronavirus test to be discharged from the hospital.  however, there is some fear that mothers who do have coronavirus may have premature babies that will need to be placed in nicus.  early in the pandemic, two small studies found that half of all pregnant women infected with coronavirus deliver their babies early and they may even pass the disease to their newborns.  in one study, researchers from china examined 33 newborns whose mothers had covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, while pregnant.  nearly 10 percent of the babies - three of them - were found to have the virus - including one that needed to be put on mechanical ventilation.  in the second study, looking at 32 pregnant women from china and hong kong, researchers found that 47 percent delivered their babies prematurely."
health,"women who suffer multiple miscarriages are at greater risk of developing diabetes, according to a study.  those who had experienced one pregnancy loss were found to be 18 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared with women who had never lost a baby.  two miscarriages was linked to a 38 per cent higher risk, and three miscarriages increased the chances by 71 per cent.  the scientists were then able to calculate the odds of developing type 2 diabetes with different numbers of miscarriages. their findings were published in the journal diabetologia [file photo]  the researchers proposed that women with three or more lost pregnancies could have their blood sugar profile more frequently monitored so that lifestyle advice can be offered to lower their risk and interventions can be applied early if diabetes develops.  the leader of the study, dr pia egerup, of copenhagen university hospital in denmark, said: â€˜we cannot rule out that the psychological distress related to pregnancy loss can initiate lifestyle changes that increase body mass index and thereby the risk of type 2 diabetes.  â€˜our analysis in which we adjusted for obesity still showed a significant association between pregnancy loss and type 2 diabetes, with more losses leading to a higher risk.  those who had experienced one pregnancy loss were found to be 18 per cent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, compared with women who had never lost a baby [file photo]  â€˜this indicated that the higher risk for type 2 diabetes in women with pregnancy losses cannot be explained by obesity alone.â€™  the researchers looked at more than 24,700 danish women born between 1957 and 1997 who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes between 1977 and 2017. they also analysed 247,740 women without diabetes as controls.  each woman with diabetes was matched by birth year and educational level with ten control women without diabetes.  the scientists were then able to calculate the odds of developing type 2 diabetes with different numbers of miscarriages. their findings were published in the journal diabetologia.  dr egerup said: â€˜perhaps the same genetic background could predispose to an increased risk for both.  â€˜also, pregnancy loss could initiate an immunological cascade that also could lead to later type 2 diabetes.  â€˜additionally, it is possible prediabetic metabolic conditions â€“ present before the diagnosis of diabetes â€“ could influence the association.â€™"
health,"a team of canadian scientists is testing whether or not marijuana compounds can block coronavirus infection.  researchers at the university of lethbridge in alberta looked at 400 cannabis strains and focused on about a dozen that showed promise in preventing the virus from 'hijacking' our cells.  they say extracts of cannabidiol (cbd), the main non-psychoactive component of pot - helped lower the number of cell receptors available for coronavirus to attach to by more than 70 percent.  however, the team says people should not rush out and by cannabis products and that clinical trials are needed to confirm the results.  researchers from the university of lethbridge in alberta, canada looked at 400 cannabis strains and focused on about a dozen (file image)  they studied how extracts high in cbd, the main nonpsychoactive ingredient in, interacted with receptors coronavirus uses to attack cells. pictured: a nurse suctions the lungs of a covid-19 patient at st. joseph's hospital in yonkers, ny, april 20  for the study, published in the pre-peer reviewed journal preprints, the scientists partnered with pathway rx, a cannabis therapy research company, and swysh inc, a cannabinoid-based research company.  the team created artificial 3d human models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues with a sample of high cbd extracts from cannabis sativa plants.  the extracts were low in thc, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.  next, researchers tested the effect the extracts had on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), the receptors required for the virus to enter human cells.  results showed that the extracts helped reduce the number of receptors that are the 'gateway' for the coronavirus to 'hijack' host cells.  the team, led by dr igor kovalchuk (pictured) found the extracts lowered the number of receptors the virus uses to infects cells and multiply by more than 70%  'a number of them have reduced the number of [virus] receptors by 73 percent, the chance of it getting in is much lower,' lead researchers dr igor kovalchuk, ceo of pathway rx, told the calgary herald.  'if they can reduce the number of receptors, there's much less chance of getting infected.'  they also looked at other receptors such as tmprss2, which allows the virus to invade cells more easily and multiply quickly.  'imagine a cell being a large building,' kovalchuk told ctv news.  'cannabinoids decrease the number of doors in the building by, say, 70 percent, so it means the level of entry will be restricted. so, therefore, you have more chance to fight it.'  however, the team says this does not mean that people should go out and buy marijuana products as prophylactics.  cannabis and cbd products that are currently on the market are not designed to treat or prevent infection from covid-19. therefore, clinical trials are needed.  'given the current dire and rapidly developing epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue needs to be considered,' kovalchuk said in an april press release.  'our research team is actively pursuing partnerships to conduct clinical trials.'  if trials proves to be successful, he says the cbd strains may be used as mouth wash, gargle, inhalants or gel caps,  'it would be cheaper for people and have a lot less side-effects,' kovalchuk told the herald."
health,"new york city vaccination rates among children have dramatically fallen during the coronavirus pandemic.  mayor bill de blasio told reporters during a press conference on wednesday that the number of administered vaccines is down 63 percent compared to this time last year.  immunizations overall have fallen by about two-thirds from this time in 2019. among children two years old and younger, they have decreased by 42 percent and in children older than age two, vaccinations are down 91 percent.  youngsters haven't been getting their typical shots against diseases such as measles and chickenpox because parents have feared their children might get coronavirus during a doctor's visit.  in addition, fewer physicians' offices are open to even administer the inoculations.  scroll down for video  vaccinations among children younger than age two have decreased by 42% and have fallen by 91% among children older than two years older, mayor de blasio revealed  the number of doses has decreased by 63% from almost 400,000 at this time last year to 150,000 over a six-week period this year (file image)  over a six-week period during this time last year, doctors administered almost 400,000 vaccine doses.  by comparison, over the six-week period this year, fewer than 150,000 doses have been administered.  dr hanan tanuos, director of primary care and an associate professor of pediatrics at rutgers new jersey medical school told dailymail.com the reason for this drop is likely two-fold.  'i think part of it of course is the parents are afraid to bring their children out and i think the other part is that the availability of doctors is limited,' she said.  the mayor stressed a child contacting an illness that could have prevented in addition to coronavirus could create a very dangerous situation.  'the vaccines that, for example, prevent respiratory illnesses like pneumonia are important any time,' de blasio said.  'a child who gets one of these diseases is likely to need to be hospitalized and they're likely to be more susceptible to contracting covid.'  de blasio said this also increases the risk of children falling ill with 'multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.'  this is the rare inflammatory condition that has been associated with covid-19 and has affected at least 145 children in the city.  he added that vaccines are not just important for children with normal immune system but also for those who are immunocompromised and therefore, more vulnerable to catching childhood diseases and coronavirus.  therefore, increasing immunization rates will not only protect kids but communities as a whole.  officials from the city's health department stressed that there is no link between jabs and coronavirus.  'we're learning more and more about how covid-19 manifests in children,' dr oxiris barbot, commissioner of the new york city department of health and mental hygiene, said during the press conference.  'that being said, there is no indication that there is any correlation with vaccination status in children.'  to help drive vaccinations up, the city will offer free vaccinations - not for covid-19 - at more than 1,000 new york city facilities and at all health and human community health clinics.  'the bottom line to all parents, all family members out there: get your child vaccinated,' de blasio said.  it comes on the heels of a recent centers for disease control and prevention report that found similar alarming declines.  vaccination rates for children aged five months and younger in michigan in may fell to 49.7 percent.  by comparison, about two-thirds of children in that age bracket were given jabs in may 2016.  public health officials have warned for years that vaccines not only protect individuals but the community as a whole in what is known as 'herd immunity'.  this occurs when the vast majority of a community - between 80 and 95 percent - becomes immune so that, if a disease is introduced, it is unable to spread.  therefore, those who are unable to be vaccinated, including the ill, very young and very old, are protected.  now, health authorities are worried that falling rates might destroy the herd immunity that had bee built up against certain diseases.  'if this goes on for long enough and enough children don't get vaccinated, then we might see small outbreaks of some of these diseases, some more easily than others,' dr joseph schwab, an associate professor of pediatrics at rutgers new jersey medical school, told dailymail.com.  he said one disease he is concerned about is pertussis, more commonly known as whooping cough.  'pertussis is one i'm concerned about because that's something that passes on from older people to the kids,' he said.  '[parents] shouldn't let fear, because of the pandemic, prevent them from getting the care.'"
health,"a new study suggests that the novel coronavirus didn't arrive in the us and sicken people before 2020.  researchers from stanford university looked at 1,700 throat swabs and did not find any of them to contain traces of the strain sars-cov-2.  the team says this doesn't mean the virus wasn't circulating in the us in 2019. but it does mean that potential patients weren't seeking care at stanford.  researchers looked at 1,700 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected between october 31, 2019 and december 31, 2019 at stanford health care. pictured: a worker performs drive-up covid-19 testing administered from a car in los angeles, california, may 13  none of the samples contained traces of the novel coronavirus. pictured: a healthcare worker takes a nasal swab sample from a new york city resident to test for covid-19, may 13  for the study, published in the pre-print server medrxiv.org, the team looked at 1,700 nasopharyngeal swab samples collected between october 31, 2019 and december 31, 2019 at stanford health care.  all of them were negative for routine respiratory virus testing and none had been tested for covid-19.  however, no traces of the virus were detected.  'no sars-cov-2 positive pools were 19 identified, consistent with limited transmission in this population at this time,' the authors wrote.  several reports have emerged implying that the virus arrived in the us as early as last year.  the first documented case of covid-19 is a man in his 50s in snohomish county, washington on january 20, 2020.  but two other residents of snohomish county tested positive for antibodies after falling ill with similar symptoms in december, reported the seattle times.  this is not the first time that health officials have had to grapple with the fact the virus may have been circulating earlier in the us.  until recently, it was believed that a resident of the lifecare center of kirkland, who died on february 26, was the first covid-19 death in america.  however, in april, it was revealed through autopsies that the first death actually occurred in santa clara, california on february 6.  similar analyses have also been performed outside of the us.  an unconfirmed report in the south china morning post indicated a covid-19 case in china's hubei province on november 17, 2019.  that's weeks earlier than when chinese officials in the city of wuhan, where the virus originated, alerted the world health organization to the outbreak.  additionally, a french study detected sars-cov-2 in a respiratory sample collected on december 27, 2019. that's a month earlier than official cases were reported in the country.  there has been an active interest in identifying the 'patient zero' of various regions to better understand how the virus spread and prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future."
health,"patients who test positive for the novel coronavirus after having recovered are not contagious, a new study finds.  researchers from the korea centers for disease control and prevention (kcdc) looked at 285 survivors who tested positive after previous tests said they were negative.  none of the 790 people that the patients came into contact with were found to be infected with covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.  the team says the findings are a sign that some areas might be safer to reopen than previously believed.  of the 790 people that about 285 're-infected' coronavirus patients came into contact with, none were found to be infected with the virus. pictured: people wearing face masks wait to take a test for the new coronavirus at a testing facility in incheon, south korea, may 13  researchers believe the patients were not re-infected but rather they they were shedding dead virus particles. pictured: staff at a covid-19 testing center pass a mouth swab self test kit to a driver at a drive-up testing center in los angeles, california, may 14  researchers also found that the virus samples collected from the patients who tested positive a second time couldn't be grown in lab cultures.  this suggests the patients were not re-infected but rather that they were shedding dead virus particles.  the results are welcome after health authorities in south korea raised alarms last month upon dozens of recovered patients testing positive for the virus again.  as of tuesday, more than 400 people have reconfirmed cases of the virus, according to the kcdc.  'we're putting more weight on the theory that dead virus fragments remain in a recovered patient's body, since we haven't seen evidence of infectivity,' dr ki moran, a professor at the national cancer center graduate school, told the wall street journal.  because of the study's results, south korean health officials will no longer consider people infectious after they recover from covid-19.  this means that after recovering or completing an isolation period, resident will not have to test negative for the virus before returning to school or work  'under the new protocols, no additional tests are required for cases that have been discharged from isolation,' the kcdc wrote in a report, according to bloomberg.  cases in which someone has tested positive again will not be referred to as 'pcr re-detected after discharge from isolation.'  the report also found that almost all of the 285 patients had antibodies, which provides more evidence that antibodies provide protection against the virus.  however, it remains unclear how many antibodies one needs to prevent being re-infected and how long they remain in the body.  the findings are not just important to south korea but across the world, including local and state governments in the us as they grapple with how to safely reopen.  one idea has been to issue 'immunity passports' or 'risk-free certificates' to people who were infected but later tested negative.  but the world health organization (who) advised against this and said the accuracy of such documents could not be guaranteed.  'some governments have suggested that the detection of antibodies to the sars-cov-2, the virus that causes covid-19, could serve as the basis for an 'immunity passport' or 'risk-free certificate' that would enable individuals to travel or to return to work assuming that they are protected against re-infection,' the who said in a statement.  'there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.'"
